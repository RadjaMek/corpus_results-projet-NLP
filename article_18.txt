Senior officials from the Trump administration, including Secretary of State **Marco Rubio**, presidential envoy **Steve Witkoff**, and adviser **Jared Kushner**, are scheduled to meet with Ukrainian representatives in Florida to discuss a possible peace settlement aimed at ending Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

The meeting follows earlier rounds of negotiations held in Geneva and takes place amid political instability in Kyiv, where President **Volodymyr Zelensky** is facing internal pressure after the resignation of his chief of staff and lead negotiator, Andriy Yermak, in connection with a corruption investigation.

At the center of the talks is a U.S.-drafted 28-point proposal that incorporates Russian input. The framework has generated controversy among European allies and U.S. lawmakers, raising concerns that it may align too closely with the demands of Russian President **Vladimir Putin**. These tensions underscore the complexity and sensitivity of the diplomatic efforts to bring the war to an end.

Senior U.S. negotiators, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, are set to meet Ukrainian officials in Florida to discuss a potential peace settlement aimed at ending Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This meeting follows prior discussions in Geneva and comes as President Zelensky faces domestic challenges, including the resignation of his top negotiator, Andriy Yermak, amid a corruption investigation. The U.S. aides’ 28-point proposal, which incorporated Russian input, has sparked controversy over whether it favors Russian demands, adding complexity to ongoing diplomatic efforts.

Where Things Stand
Ukraine peace talks: Secretary of State Marco Rubio said there was still “much work to do” on a proposal to end the war with Russia after talks with Ukrainian officials in Florida. Neither he nor Rustem Umerov, who led the Ukrainian delegation after the resignation of President Volodymyr Zelensky’s longtime chief of staff, revealed details of the discussions, although both called the talks productive. Steve Witkoff, a special envoy for President Trump, planned to travel to Moscow on Monday to meet Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin. Read more ›

Boat strikes: Lawmakers from both parties said they were deeply concerned about a Washington Post report that the U.S. military had conducted a follow-up strike to kill the survivors of an initial attack on a vessel that administration officials claimed was carrying drugs. The lawmakers said such a strike would constitute a war crime. Read more ›

Venezuela airspace: Mr. Trump said on Saturday that the airspace around Venezuela was closed, escalating what his administration has called a war against drug cartels. The United States has been building up its military presence in the Caribbean to put pressure on Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro. Read more ›



Asked whether he had made a decision on who will replace Jerome H. Powell as Fed chair when his term expires in May 2026, President Trump just told reporters on Air Force One that he knew who he was going to pick but offered no further details. Trump has frequently criticized Powell since returning to office, complaining that the Fed has not cut interest rates as quickly as he desires.


Steve Witkoff, a businessman who is a special envoy for President Trump, plans to fly to Moscow on Monday, a U.S. official said. Witkoff plans to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to discuss the Russian military’s invasion of Ukraine.


President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said he had received a preliminary report from the delegation in Florida led by Rustem Umerov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, but did not provide further details. “It is important that the talks have a constructive dynamic and that all issues were discussed openly and with a clear focus on ensuring Ukraine’s sovereignty and national interests,” he wrote on X, thanking the Trump administration “for the time that is being invested so intensively.”

“We will continue working,” added Zelensky, who is due in Paris on Monday for meetings.


On Russian state television, the influential weekly news show “Vesti Nedeli” spent the first 15 minutes on Sunday night discussing different facets of the peace negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, but avoided mentioning the talks in Miami between the United States and Ukraine. Much of the focus was on the growing corruption scandal enveloping the government in Kyiv, which forced a change in the Ukrainian delegation after the resignation of Andriy Yermak, President Volodymyr Zelensky’s chief of staff. The Russian report suggested that the previous U.S. administration had, in its zeal to support Ukraine, turned a blind eye toward the misuse of American aid.


Rustem Umerov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, said Ukraine was grateful to U.S. leadership for the “tremendous work” and for being “super supportive.” He called today’s meeting “productive and successful,” telling reporters in very brief remarks after Marco Rubio spoke that “we’ll keep you updated” on any later stages. It was not immediately clear when Ukraine’s delegation would return home; President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, meanwhile, is due in Paris tomorrow.


The meeting between Marco Rubio, Jared Kushner, Steve Witkoff and the Ukrainian delegation here in South Florida has just ended. Rubio and his Ukrainian counterpart emerged and said the talks were productive, but revealed very little and took no questions. Rubio said this latest session built on talks held with Ukrainians in Geneva earlier this month but acknowledged that “there’s more work to be done.”

He added: “This is delicate. It’s complicated. There are a lot of moving parts, and obviously there’s another party involved here that will have to be a part of the equation, and that will continue later this week.”

Up next: Witkoff heads to Moscow this week to meet with the Russians.

Lawmakers suggest a follow-up strike on a boat in the Caribbean could be a war crime.

A top Republican and Democrats in Congress suggested on Sunday that American military officials might have committed a war crime in President Trump’s offensive against boats in the Caribbean after a news report said that during one such attack, a follow-up strike was ordered to kill survivors.

The remarks came in response to a Washington Post report on Friday that said that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had given a verbal order to kill everyone aboard boats suspected of smuggling drugs, and that this led a military commander to carry out a second strike to kill those who had initially survived an attack in early September.

“Obviously if that occurred, that would be very serious, and I agree that that would be an illegal act,” Representative Mike Turner, Republican of Ohio and a former chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said on “Face the Nation” on CBS.

Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said on CBS that if the report was accurate, the attack “rises to the level of a war crime.” And on CNN, when asked if he believed a second strike to kill survivors constituted a war crime, Senator Mark Kelly, Democrat of Arizona, answered, “It seems to.”

The lawmakers’ comments came after top Republicans and Democrats on the two congressional committees overseeing the Pentagon vowed over the weekend to increase their scrutiny of U.S. boat strikes in the Caribbean after the report. Mr. Turner said the article had only sharpened lawmakers’ already grave questions about the operation.

“There are very serious concerns in Congress about the attacks on the so-called drug boats down in the Caribbean and the Pacific, and the legal justification that’s been provided,” he said. “But this is completely outside of anything that’s been discussed with Congress, and there is an ongoing investigation.”

The investigations by both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees are the sharpest scrutiny to date by Congress of Mr. Trump’s escalating military offensive, undertaken without congressional approval or consultation, which he says is aimed at taking out drug traffickers.

They constitute a notable step by Republican lawmakers who have spent much of the year deferring to Mr. Trump and refraining from exercising oversight of his actions.

Senators Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the committee’s top Democrat, said on Friday night that they had “directed inquiries” to the Defense Department.

“We will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances,” they wrote.

The House Armed Services Committee followed suit on Saturday. In a joint statement, Representatives Mike Rogers, Republican of Alabama and the panel’s chairman, and Adam Smith of Washington, the senior Democrat, said that they were “committed to providing rigorous oversight” of the boat strikes and that they were “taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question.”

The United States has built up a military presence in the Caribbean meant to put pressure on Venezuela. Trump administration officials have said that they are trying to deter drug smuggling, and that the boat strikes, which have killed more than 80 people since early September, are part of a purported formal armed conflict with drug cartels. But members of Congress have been voicing concerns over the legal justification being used to conduct them.

The Washington Post reported this week that in the first boat attack, on Sept. 2, there had been survivors in the water after the first missile strike and the military carried out a second one to kill them because of Mr. Hegseth’s orders. The Intercept also reported in September that the military had carried out a follow-up strike to kill the survivors of an initial strike.

In a statement on Friday, Mr. Hegseth denounced The Post’s report. He defended the military’s actions and said officials had been clear in all the operations that the boat strikes were designed to be “lethal, kinetic strikes.”

Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Mr. Trump expressed confidence in Mr. Hegseth. The president suggested that he “wouldn’t have wanted” a second strike that killed survivors, before reiterating that he believed Mr. Hegseth had denied that account of the attack. The defense secretary did not directly contradict The Post’s reporting in his Friday statement but called it “fabricated and inflammatory.”

Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, called for Mr. Hegseth to release “the full, unedited tapes of the strikes so the American people can see for themselves.”

Democrats have repeatedly criticized the boat strikes as illegal, likening them to extrajudicial killings. Mr. Kelly was part of a group of six lawmakers who made a video this month that reminded troops they were obligated to refuse illegal orders, though it did not mention any specific order.

On Sunday, Mr. Kelly, who is being investigated by the Pentagon for his remarks in the video, said he had “serious concerns about anybody in that chain of command stepping over a line that they should never step over.” He also suggested that lawmakers would put officials “under oath” in their scrutiny of the boat strikes.

Mr. Turner’s comments and the moves by Mr. Wicker and Mr. Rogers suggested that Republicans, too, were increasingly concerned about the scope and legality of the operations.

The committees’ promise for stronger oversight also comes as a small number of hard-right Republicans, including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, have voiced dismay over foreign policy entanglements that they say are at odds with Mr. Trump’s promised “America First” approach.

Still, many Republicans have expressed support for the military operations in Venezuela. On Sunday, Senator Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, a close Trump ally, dismissed The Post’s report and defended the administration.

Mr. Mullin, who is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Mr. Trump was “protecting the United States by being very proactive.”

Julian E. Barnes and Charlie Savage contributed reporting.


Rustem Umerov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Florida that he was looking forward to a “productive” meeting with the U.S. delegation. In a separate post on X signalling that the meeting had begun, Umerov added that he was “in constant contact” with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and would report back to him after the meetings.

“We have clear directives and priorities: safeguarding Ukrainian interests, ensuring substantive dialogue, and advancing on the basis of the progress achieved in Geneva,” Umerov wrote. “We are working to secure real peace for Ukraine and reliable, long-term security guarantees.”

Security guarantees have long been a sticking point for Ukraine. The early draft of the U.S.-backed peace proposal included a promise of security guarantees to prevent another Russian invasion that would be enforced in part by the United States, but without detailing the level of commitment to Ukraine’s defense.



Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Jared Kushner, President Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff and the Ukrainian delegation just welcomed reporters into the room where they’re meeting at a private sports club north of Miami.

“This is about ending a war in a way that creates a mechanism and a way forward that will allow them to be independent and sovereign, never have another war again, and create tremendous prosperity for its people,” Rubio said. He was sitting on one side of the table, flanked by Witkoff and Kushner. On the other side were the Ukrainian officials, led by Rustem Umerov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council. Now the meeting has begun.


Secretary of State Marco Rubio has arrived for a round of peace talks this morning with Jared Kushner, Steve Witkoff and a delegation from Ukraine. There is expected to be a news conference later, when the talks finish up. Meanwhile, President Trump is a bit farther north, playing a round golf at his property near Mar-a-Lago. He posted on social media this morning about a Fox News segment he liked, as well as a message criticizing former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has offered few clues about his delegation’s specific positions going into today’s talks. Zelensky said in a social media post Sunday that he’d spoken to Finland’s president to brief him on “what the Ukrainian delegation is preparing” and also “the signals we have received” from U.S. officials. He did not provide further details, saying only that “this week will involve a lot of work with partners in Europe.”

“It is important that we all share the same view of the situation and the understanding that pressure on Russia as the sole cause of this war — not on Ukraine — can actually work for peace,” added Zelensky, who is expected to meet with President Emmanuel Macron of France in Paris on Monday.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio emerged from talks with Ukrainian officials in Florida on Sunday to say that there was still “much work to do” on a proposal to end the war with Russia.

Missing from the Ukrainian group was Andriy Yermak, President Volodymyr Zelensky’s right-hand man and chief of staff who resigned on Friday amid a corruption investigation. Mr. Yermak had served as lead negotiator in recent talks with American officials.

Neither Mr. Rubio nor Rustem Umerov, who led the Ukrainian delegation after Mr. Yermak’s resignation, revealed details of the discussions, although both described the talks as productive. Steve Witkoff, a special envoy for President Trump, plans to travel to Moscow on Monday to meet President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, according to a U.S. official.

Mr. Zelensky said on Sunday evening that he had received a preliminary report from the delegation in Florida. “It is important that the talks have a constructive dynamic and that all issues were discussed openly and with a clear focus on ensuring Ukraine’s sovereignty and national interests,” he wrote on X, thanking the Trump administration “for the time that is being invested so intensively.”

Ukrainian officials have insisted that the dynamics of the discussions would not fundamentally change, even though Mr. Yermak had played a central role and was replaced in Florida by Mr. Umerov, the head of the National Security and Defense Council.

Last week, Mr. Yermak negotiated to soften a draft proposal to end the war from the Trump administration, whose 28 points largely reflected Russian demands. These included withdrawing from territory in eastern Ukraine, forgoing NATO membership and ruling out a postwar Western peacekeeping force for Ukraine.

The proposal included a promise of security guarantees to prevent another Russian invasion that would be enforced in part by the United States, but without detailing the level of commitment to Ukraine’s defense.

With Ukraine facing pressure on the battlefield and from the White House, the continued involvement of Mr. Yermak — whose home was raided by investigators on Friday — was seen by some Ukrainians as a potential distraction in negotiations.

His departure helped ease worries in Ukraine that Russia or the United States might use the $100 million embezzlement scandal as leverage to push Kyiv to make painful concessions in talks.

Top negotiators for President Trump plan to meet with Ukrainian officials in Florida on Sunday to discuss a possible peace settlement to halt Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to a senior U.S. official.

The American negotiators who plan to attend the talks are Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Steve Witkoff, a special envoy for the president; and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and a businessman who does some international diplomacy for Mr. Trump.

The meeting follows a round of talks between those officials and Ukrainian negotiators last weekend in Geneva. In Kyiv, President Volodymyr Zelensky is grappling with the fallout from a corruption investigation that led to the resignation on Friday of his top negotiator and chief of staff, Andriy Yermak. Mr. Yermak had participated in the Geneva talks, and had appeared with Mr. Rubio to discuss them with reporters.

Russian officials said earlier that Mr. Witkoff planned to travel to Moscow next week.

The recent diplomacy has become fraught because of questions about whether some of Mr. Trump’s aides are favoring the demands of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at the expense of Mr. Zelensky and Ukrainians, whose country is besieged by the Russian military.

After Mr. Trump told them last month to make a push on resolving the war, Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner drafted a 28-point proposal, incorporating Russian input. During the process, the two Americans met secretly in Miami with Kirill Dmitriev, an envoy for Mr. Putin who is in charge of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund.

The Americans also met in Florida this month with Rustem Umerov, the national security adviser to Mr. Zelensky. Mr. Umerov will be part of the Ukrainian group on Sunday, Mr. Zelensky said in a social media post on Saturday.

“The American side is demonstrating a constructive approach, and in the coming days it is feasible to flesh out the steps to determine how to bring the war to a dignified end,” Mr. Zelensky said in a separate social media post on Saturday, adding that the Ukrainians traveling to the United States had “the necessary directives.”

European allies and some U.S. lawmakers, including Republicans, expressed alarm after they learned that U.S. and Russian officials had worked together on a peace plan, and after the text of the proposal was leaked. Last Saturday, several U.S. senators said that Mr. Rubio had called them that day as he was flying to Geneva for talks and had told them that the plan had been composed by Russia.

Mr. Rubio then said that Ukrainians had also shared ideas for it. But he acknowledged to reporters in Geneva that U.S. officials had begun by looking at Russian demands, and received oral and written input from the Russians.

U.S. and Ukrainian officials expressed optimism about the talks after holding long rounds of discussions in Geneva last Sunday. Officials had whittled the 28-point proposal down, and Mr. Rubio said that items that involved NATO and European nations had been taken out and set aside for separate negotiations that would require European input. Mr. Zelensky said he would speak to Mr. Trump directly about “the sensitive issues,” which presumably include territory.

This week, leaked recordings and transcripts posted by Bloomberg News revealed separate, earlier conversations among Mr. Witkoff and Russian officials that raised questions about whether Mr. Witkoff was negotiating on behalf of the Russians, presenting their demands as American recommendations. Mr. Trump told reporters he had not listened to the recording, but said he was not concerned.

Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance had approved of the original 28-point proposal, and a friend of Mr. Vance, Daniel P. Driscoll, the Army secretary, has also been involved in the diplomacy this month. Some advocates of a pullback of U.S. military involvement from Ukraine say that it will be difficult, perhaps impossible, to reach a settlement that Ukrainians and their supporters consider fair, but that it is important to try to bring an end to the war.

Despite European concerns over the peace talks, Mr. Rubio plans to take the highly unusual step of skipping a meeting of foreign ministers of NATO member nations in Brussels next week.



Trump declares Venezuelan airspace closed.

President Trump warned airlines and pilots on Saturday that the airspace near Venezuela was closed, ratcheting up what his administration has characterized as a war against drug cartels.

In a post on social media to “all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers,” the president wrote that the airspace above and surrounding Venezuela should be considered “CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.”

Mr. Trump did not go into further detail in his post, but it came after he warned on Thursday night that the United States could “very soon” expand its attacks on boats thought to be carrying drugs in the waters off Venezuela to targets inside the country itself. The U.S. boat strikes have killed more than 80 people since early September.

As president of the United States, Mr. Trump has no authority over Venezuelan airspace. But foreign governments and airlines often follow the United States’ lead. Earlier this month, a handful of foreign carriers had canceled flights to Venezuela after the Federal Aviation Administration issued a safety warning about the country. For now, several hundred flights from other countries into Venezuela remain scheduled for December, most of them operated by smaller airlines in the region, according to Cirium, an aviation data firm.

The effect on air travel between the United States and Venezuela will probably be limited. There are no scheduled direct flights between the two countries, according to Cirium. Direct flights from the United States to other South American destinations generally avoid Venezuelan airspace.

The United States has built up a substantial military presence in the Caribbean to put pressure on Venezuela. Administration officials have said their goal is to deter drug smuggling, but they have also made clear that they want to see Mr. Maduro removed from power, possibly by force.

People briefed on the Trump administration’s Venezuelan strike deliberations have said that the initial targets could be drug-related sites, including production or storage facilities used by Colombian cartels that ship cocaine through Venezuela. American spy agencies have given the military intelligence about the locations of such sites in both Venezuela and Colombia.

“President Trump’s reckless actions towards Venezuela are pushing America closer and closer to another costly foreign war,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said in a statement. “Under our Constitution, Congress has the sole power to declare war — not the president — and Congress has not authorized the use of military force against Venezuela.”

Whether Mr. Trump plans to conduct strikes imminently is not clear, but the actions and threats have the effect of increasing pressure on Mr. Maduro and his government.

On Friday, The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump had spoken by phone last week with Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan leader, even as the United States continued to threaten military action against Venezuela.

The conversation took place late in the week, two people with knowledge of the discussion said. It included a discussion about a possible meeting in the United States between the two leaders, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. There are no plans at the moment for a meeting, one of the people said.

The phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Maduro, which included Secretary of State Marco Rubio, came days before the State Department officially designated Mr. Maduro as the leader of what the administration considers a drug cartel that is also a foreign terrorist organization, the Cartel de los Soles.

U.S. military officials have developed a range of target options for Mr. Trump, including Venezuelan military units that support Mr. Maduro or are believed to profit from the drug trade.

Other options have included oil-related facilities. Those strikes could be justified as part of a counterdrug initiative, though they would also likely be an attempt to weaken Mr. Maduro’s hold on power by cutting off access to his funding and dramatically ramping up the pressure on him.

Mr. Trump has consistently talked about Venezuela as a source of drugs and illegal immigration into the United States.

The immigration story is complicated. Large numbers of Venezuelans have come to the United States, but many were fleeing Mr. Maduro’s authoritarian government. While the Trump administration has accused a Venezuelan prison gang of fueling violence, the administration has ignored assessments saying that Mr. Maduro does not control the group, Tren de Aragua, and instead has tried to manipulate the intelligence.

In reality, Venezuela plays only a small part in the drug trade in America, according to drug experts and U.S. government assessments. Cocaine produced in Colombia does pass through Venezuela, but most of it goes to Europe. Colombian cocaine that is headed to the United States is exported through the Pacific Ocean. And U.S. agencies have determined that fentanyl is produced almost entirely in Mexico, not in Venezuela, with chemicals imported from China.

From the beginning, the boat strikes have come under criticism from Democrats, who have said they are unauthorized, illegal and amount to murder or extrajudicial killing. And on Saturday, critics of the campaign said the closing of the airspace amounted to a threat to use force.

“Threats of the use of force, much less an actual attack on Venezuela, would violate the U.N. Charter,” said Brian Finucane, a former State Department lawyer who is a specialist in the laws of armed conflict. “Any such attack would also lack congressional authorization.”

Republican criticism has been far more muted. But on Friday evening, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, said he would investigate the boat strikes.

On Thursday, The Washington Post reported that for the first strike, on Sept. 2, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a verbal order to kill everyone on the boat. And CNN reported that after the military detected survivors, a second attack was carried out to kill them.

In September, The New York Times reported there were multiple strikes during the first operation. The Times also reported that the boat that was struck had altered its course and appeared to have turned around before the attack started because the people onboard had apparently spotted a military aircraft stalking it.

In a statement, the Pentagon denounced the Post report but said officials had been clear in all the operations that they were designed to be “lethal, kinetic strikes.”

While Mr. Hegseth has been clear that he ordered “lethal strikes,” the orders around follow-on strikes are not clear, nor is whether Mr. Hegseth or a military officer directly ordered a strike to kill survivors in the water. In a later operation, on Oct. 16, two survivors were rescued and transported back to their home countries.

In a joint statement, Mr. Wicker and the committee’s top Democrat, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, said they would examine the follow-on strikes that the military had carried out.

“The committee has directed inquiries to the department, and we will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances,” the statement said.
