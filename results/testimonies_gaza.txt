TÉMOIGNAGE: Here’s what we know:
An Israeli colonel projected confidence as he described the battle against Hamas as “catching a mouse.” In Amman, Jordan, the Egyptian and Jordanian foreign ministers urged the U.S. secretary of state to push for a cease-fire.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It’s like catching a mouse,” Colonel Ben-Anat said of the enemy.
Speaker: Anat
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “You have to find him.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: You don’t know where he is — but you know when you catch him, he’s done.”

Nearby, groups of soldiers gathered around portable camping stoves, boiling sweet corn and carrots, chatting and joking.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “United, together,” said Colonel Ben-Anat.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We do our best to destroy Hamas only, without harming the civilians,” said Colonel Ben-Anat.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We’ll think 10 times before we do something.”

But for the civilians in Gaza City, who have witnessed one of the most intense bombing campaigns of the 21st century, the Israeli army’s approach is terrifying.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I am afraid to go out one night and meet a tank,” Mr. Abu Adgham said in a phone interview.
Speaker: Abu Adgham
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We don’t have internet to listen to the news and know what is happening — but we can hear it,” said Majdi Ahmed, 32, a taxi driver taking shelter in a hospital in the city.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Now I can hear the shooting,” Mr. Ahmed said in a voice message.
Speaker: Ahmed
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Seems they are now fighting.”

A Weakened Hamas Still Dominates Gaza, Building Day by Day
A cease-fire after two years of war with Israel has allowed Hamas to tighten its grip on power again.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It’s still standing,” one Israeli official said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Hamas was hit hard, but it wasn’t defeated,” said Shalom Ben Hanan, a former senior official in the Shin Bet, Israel’s domestic intelligence agency.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It’s still standing.”

This swift regrouping presents a formidable obstacle to the Trump administration’s plan to reconstruct a Gaza free of Hamas.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “They’re trying to convey to the public that they’re still in charge and they’re providing security,” said Nidal Kuhail, 31, a resident of Gaza City.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “You can feel their presence, but they also appear to be weaker than the past.”

Husam Badran, a senior Hamas official, said the group was prepared to allow a committee of Palestinian technocrats to take over the administration of Gaza.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “That would be the most dangerous decision,” he said in an interview.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The police, he added, were seeking to “preserve security and stability.”

Still, Hamas has used brutal tactics to settle scores with rivals.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Mr. Badran said Hamas was ready to discuss the issue of the group’s weapons, but only in the context of “serious” talks about a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, a total halt to military operations in the territory, and the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem.
Speaker: Badran
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Without that, talking about these matters would be nonsensical,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Without value.” He also suggested that Hamas was open to a long-term truce.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “This territory will be demilitarized, and Hamas will be disarmed,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel told a government meeting in mid-November.
Speaker: Israel
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Either this will happen the easy way or it will happen the hard way.”

Israeli political and military officials have complained that with each passing day of the cease-fire, Hamas is deepening its control and reorganizing its forces, making it harder to introduce a viable alternative to replace it.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It happened very quickly,” Moshe Tur-Paz, a centrist Israeli lawmaker, said of Hamas’s resurgence.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “The moment to bring in the new government was the moment the cease-fire started,” said Mr. Tur-Paz, a member of Israel’s parliamentary Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, which receives classified briefings on security affairs.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Hamas was at its weakest.”

The slow process of setting up a new government for Gaza is playing in Hamas’s favor, he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Hamas is besieged,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “But if it continues controlling parts of Gaza and wants to rebuild its capacities, it will find a way to rebuild them.”

He added, “The next battle might be in 10 or 20 years, but it could be much worse than Oct. 7.”

Title: Israel Says a Gaza Border Will Reopen, but Only for Palestinians to Leave

Speaker: He
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Israel has said it will reopen “in the coming days,” but Egypt denies this.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Israel said on Wednesday that it would begin allowing some Palestinians to leave the Gaza Strip for Egypt “in the coming days” through the Rafah border crossing.
Speaker: Israel
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Palestinian officials condemned the killings as a “field execution.”

The shooting came amid days of extensive Israeli military operations and raids in the Israeli-occupied northern West Bank.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: In a joint statement, the Israeli military and police acknowledged that the Palestinians had been shot at, saying “fire was directed toward the suspects.” They said the shooting was being reviewed by commanders on the ground and transferred to the “relevant professional bodies.”

The statement also said that the two Palestinians had previously been involved in militant activity, including throwing explosives at security forces and opening fire on them.
Speaker: They
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “The fighters acted exactly as is expected from them — terrorists need to die!” he wrote on X.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: On Thursday, Volker Türk, the United Nations human rights chief, expressed outrage at the “apparent summary execution” of the two Palestinians.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The foreign ministry of the Palestinian Authority condemned the killing as an “ugly field execution” and called on the international community to act.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “The ministry sees this crime as directly extending from an official, systematic, and widespread Israeli policy based on intentionally killing Palestinians outside the framework of the law,” the ministry said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Kingdom, said the killings were “part of a pattern across the occupied territory.”

B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights group, said the shootings were the result of “an accelerated process of dehumanization of Palestinians and the complete abandonment of their lives” by Israel.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The compounds, or “Alternative Safe Communities,” as U.S. officials are calling them, will be concentrated in the eastern half of Gaza, currently controlled by Israel since a cease-fire took effect in October.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “There’s a practical issue: How do we get people into safe housing as soon as humanly possible?” Aryeh Lightstone, a senior Trump administration official who is leading the effort, said in an interview.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “This is the easiest way to do that.”

In the short term, the plan could offer relief for thousands of Palestinians who have endured two years of war.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The proposal is an outgrowth of the Trump administration’s peace plan, which left Gaza divided into a Hamas-controlled “red zone” and Israeli-held “green zone.” But it also reflects the lack of progress in ousting and disarming Hamas, as the peace plan required, leaving U.S. and Israeli officials to do what they can where they can.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “The people in Gaza are not pieces of furniture that you move from one place to another,” said Ayed Abu Ramadan, the chairman of the Gaza Governorate Chamber of Commerce.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “They have emotions and attachments.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: They want to be as close as they can to their destroyed homes.”

A key objective, two U.S. officials said, is to kick-start the enclave’s economy by creating jobs, including for the Palestinian laborers who officials say will build the new compounds.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: As recently as last May, President Trump mocked the United States’ long record of “nation building” in the Middle East.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Yes to peace, no to violence!” people chanted.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Pursuing peace is a Jewish act,” declared Yair Lapid, the leader of the opposition and head of the centrist Yesh Atid party.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Mr. Rabin “knew that peace is not weakness, but strength and power,” said Yair Golan, a former general who leads the left-wing Democrats party.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: It also made “peace” a dirty word in Israel’s steadily right-drifting politics, a telltale of naïveté — or, even worse, of leftism.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Many in his coalition would still prefer to break it and return to a full-blown war in pursuit of “total victory,” rather than risk Hamas surviving, regrouping, rearming and rebuilding the capacity to threaten Israel militarily.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: So far, the Israeli prime minister’s own talk of peace — revived under Mr. Trump’s influence — has mostly hewed to an old conservative formulation, “peace through strength.”

Much will hinge, too, on how those seeking to defeat him will position themselves to Israeli voters who are worn out from the war but also deeply skeptical of the prospects for peace.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “In a way, Trump liberated the liberal camp from its long silence about peace,” said Gayil Talshir, a political science professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It’s not going to help them,” she added.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It’s much easier nowadays to tell Israelis, ‘You cannot live with the Palestinians because of Oct. 7’.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: So for the liberal camp to win, the election must be fought over what kind of Israel you want to have — a religious, nationalistic, authoritarian state, or a liberal, Jewish democracy.”

In Saturday night’s speeches, a great deal of attention was paid to how Mr. Rabin had been a warrior for Israel before seeking peace with the Palestinians.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: On Saturday night, he said the three shots that killed Mr. Rabin still echo today, “every time the government incites against its citizens, every time patriots are called traitors, every time protesters exercising their civic responsibility are beaten.”

Mr. Lapid, the centrist opposition leader, argued that the right-wing and religious parties in the governing coalition, like Mr. Rabin’s detractors, were distorting the very idea of Jewishness and turning it into something violent.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “The violent racism of Itamar Ben-Gvir is not Judaism,” he said, referring to Mr. Netanyahu’s national security minister.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Anyone who suggests dropping an atomic bomb on Gaza does not represent Judaism,” he added, referring to another ultranationalist minister’s suggestion.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Settler violence is not Judaism,” Mr. Lapid said.
Speaker: Lapid
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Judaism does not belong to the extremists, nor to the corrupt, nor to the draft dodgers.”

David M. Halbfinger is the Jerusalem bureau chief, leading coverage of Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “There’s going to be ups and downs and twists and turns, but I think we have a lot of reason for healthy optimism about the progress that’s being made,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: He said it was intended “to support stabilization efforts” and that 200 U.S. troops had begun to put it together.
Speaker: He
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We’ll be assigning some career-experienced State Department personnel to sort of be there to help coordinate all these efforts,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It’s important, and particularly over the next couple weeks, that we keep the cease-fire together.”

On Friday, he said that partner nations and nongovernmental groups would also provide expertise to the center, and he said the United States was willing to work with the United Nations on aid and other elements of the peace plan.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It involves bringing together all the nation-states that are offering to provide personnel and resources,” he said, adding that the countries taking part would need to be ones “that Israel is comfortable with.”

Mr. Rubio declined to give details about how the force would be assembled or how it would operate.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We don’t think it’s going to happen,” Mr. Rubio said.
Speaker: Rubio
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Mr. Rubio said after the meeting that Mr. Trump had made enforcing the cease-fire a “top priority” and that “we’re going to get there despite substantial obstacles.” The United States is by far the largest provider of military aid to Israel, and the president has approved substantial weapon packages to the country since taking office in January.
Speaker: Rubio
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “The kids said sadly, ‘We wish we were buried with them,’” Ms. al-Jaja, 32, said when we contacted her again recently.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Even that closure has been taken from us,” she said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: They paid nearly $4,000 to a truck driver to load half their belongings — it was “pay or risk death,” the driver told them, Ms. al-Jaja said.
Speaker: Jaja
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: He told us how they found each other at what had been the border between north and south Gaza: “I switched on the flashlight of my old Nokia phone and began shouting into the dark — ‘Ashraf!
Speaker: He
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Mohammed!’ — hoping she could hear me and find me more easily,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I ran and hugged her and our children with everything in me,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Since Israel broke the cease-fire in March, their days have been spent in a perpetual struggle against hunger and danger, which Mr. Malaka said were like “endless waves crashing over us.”

Without work, he said, he has taken the risk of grabbing supplies from passing aid trucks or lining up at aid distribution points.
Speaker: Malaka
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “The hardest thing is living with the feeling that all you can do is wait for death,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: He added: “Now I look at my children and wonder, will I see them alive in the months ahead?
Speaker: He
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: And as a father, will I have the strength to protect them?”

He no longer sells shawarma to eager customers.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Daily life is another kind of war,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “This is what life has been reduced to: moving from one danger to another, trying to feed my children, trying simply to survive.”

The anguish of just getting through the day came up again and again as we spoke to people about what it feels like to live through the war.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We have been given one option only: that is to die,” he told us at the time.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I feel like I betrayed my own country by leaving, but sometimes I also think that I deserve a chance in life,” she said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It’s a confusing and constant fight with myself,” she added.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “My tears poured down, thinking I can afford to buy food and eat, but they can barely get anything,” she said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Whatever happens, I’ll end up in Gaza,” she said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Staying in Italy is just a temporary solution.”

We reached dozens of people who had been able to leave Gaza for places like Italy, Jordan and Egypt.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “There isn’t a school for him to attend, anyway,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “There isn’t a glimmer of hope left in Gaza,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Me, and everyone else I know, just wants to get out.”

Many of the people we spoke to wanted to leave Gaza.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: As Israel’s full-scale assault in Gaza City began last month, Khitam Ayyad fled from her home there barefoot and without her possessions, heading to an area in southern Gaza that the Israeli military had designated as a “humanitarian zone.”

The military said that tents, food and medical care would be provided to those fleeing the fighting in the north.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We are exposed to the sun and the heat,” she said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: There was no space for her to build a shelter, she added, and “no proper food or water.”

The Israeli military has said that its ground assault to take control of Gaza City, which began on Sept. 16, is an effort to rout one of the last remaining Hamas strongholds in Gaza.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Before the operation, the military said that the humanitarian infrastructure in southern Gaza was prepared for “the expected population volume moving from northern Gaza.”

This week, the military said that 780,000 people had left Gaza City since an evacuation order was issued on Sept. 9.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Olga Cherevko, a spokeswoman for the United Nations’ humanitarian office who is working in a designated humanitarian zone, said there were “hundreds of people just sitting on the side of the road looking shellshocked, without anything.”

On Monday, President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel backed a proposal to end the war, which was ignited by a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The plan stated that “full aid” would be sent “immediately” to Gaza once the plan went into effect, but it remained unclear if Hamas would accept the deal.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Accordingly, the transfer of food, medical equipment and shelter supplies has been increased,” COGAT said in a statement on Sept. 25.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Steps have been taken in the fields of water and medical response in the southern Gaza Strip.”

But two weeks into the offensive, there appeared to be little sign of that infrastructure, a visit by a New York Times photographer to the humanitarian zone showed and Palestinians and aid groups said in interviews.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “The hospitals are completely overflowing,” Ms. Cherevko said.
Speaker: Cherevko
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “The water production is at some of the lowest levels that we’ve ever seen.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: There’s all kinds of diseases.”

Since the ground offensive in Gaza City began, aid agencies say, efforts to alleviate a worsening humanitarian crisis across Gaza have been plunged into chaos.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: When asked about the closure, the Israeli military said the entry of aid trucks through Zikim was “subject to operational considerations.”

On land west of Nuseirat Camp in central Gaza, displaced Palestinians from Gaza City pitch their tent.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The Israeli military said in a statement that aid deliveries from southern to northern Gaza were “facilitated through internal coordination” between itself and aid groups, and that the delivery of aid “continues on an ongoing basis.”

Israel’s ground offensive in Gaza City has also devastated health care there.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: On Wednesday, the Red Cross said it would suspend operations and move its staff out of the city, days after Doctors Without Borders, a medical charity, announced a similar move saying that Israeli forces had “encircled” their facilities.
Speaker: Red Cross
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I went yesterday to what used to be the market in Shati, but no one was selling a thing there,” she said, referring to one of Gaza City’s neighborhoods.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We have food enough for one more week at best.”

Aid agencies say the Israeli military appeared to have been unprepared for the exodus of people its Gaza City offensive would unleash.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Is there food and water in al-Mawasi?
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Yes,” Ms. Ingram, the UNICEF spokeswoman, said, referring to one of the designated humanitarian zones in the south.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Is it sufficient for the people who are currently here?
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Definitely not.”

Bassem al-Qedra, 43, said he and his children slept on the street for three days after he fled to Khan Younis from Gaza City.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “No water, no food, no money,” said Mr. al-Qedra, who worked as a taxi driver before his car was destroyed in the war.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “No one could help.”

After 21 months of devastating conflict with Israel, Gaza’s most vulnerable civilians — the young, the old and the sick — are facing what aid groups say is impending famine.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “He is not responding to the treatment,” said his father, A’eed Abu Khater, 48, who has been sheltering in a tent in Gaza City with his wife and five children.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I feel helpless,” he added in a phone call, his voice strained with grief.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We lost our income in the war.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: There is nothing.”

Gaza’s hospitals have struggled since early in the war to cope with the influx of Palestinians injured and maimed by Israeli airstrikes and, more recently, by shootings meant to disperse desperate crowds as they surge toward food convoys or head to aid distribution sites.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “There is no one in Gaza now outside the scope of famine, not even myself,” said Dr. Ahmed al-Farra, who leads the pediatric ward at Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I am speaking to you as a health official, but I, too, am searching for flour to feed my family.”

The World Food Program, an arm of the United Nations, said this week that the hunger crisis in Gaza had reached “new and astonishing levels of desperation, with a third of the population not eating for multiple days in a row.”

Dr. al-Farra said the number of children dying of malnutrition had risen sharply in recent days.
Speaker: Farra
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I walk the streets looking for food,” she said by phone, her voice barely audible.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “As an adult, I can bear the hunger,” she said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “But my kids can’t.”

Mohammed, according to his doctor, had pre-existing health problems affecting his brain and his muscle development.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I look at him and I can’t help but cry,” she said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We go to bed hungry and wake up thinking only about how to find food,” she added.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I can’t find milk or diapers.”

Mohammed was diagnosed with severe malnutrition by the Friends of the Patient clinic and Al-Rantisi children’s hospital, she said, but there was little they could do.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: On a recent visit to the clinic, she said, “they told me, ‘His treatment is food and water.’”

Yahia al-Najjar was 4 months old when he died of severe malnutrition on Tuesday at the American Hospital in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, his aunt, Safa al-Najjar, 38, said in an interview.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: While the treatment may briefly relieve symptoms, Mr. Saqr warned, “they feel the hunger again soon after.” He added, “Some arrive shivering from hunger.”

The hospital’s limited supply of IV solution cannot meet the growing demand, he said, adding: “The team is exhausted from hunger.
Speaker: He
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Yesterday, some staff members ate just 10 spoons of plain white rice.”

Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City had recorded three deaths from malnutrition in the previous 36 hours, Dr. Mohammad Abu Salmiya, the hospital director, said in an interview on Tuesday.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: When she was reunited with her mother, she flashed a kind of V-sign with her bandaged left hand — a “rock on” gesture made up of her thumb and her index and little fingers because her two middle fingers were missing.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The next morning, she thanked her family, friends and God in an Instagram post and declared, “I have returned to life.”

Ms. Damari still faced months of arduous rehabilitation in the hospital and at a halfway hotel where she stayed with other former hostages, as well as surgery for the wounds she sustained when she was abducted.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: It is a different life from what she calls the “simple, ordinary, banal” existence she once knew in Kfar Aza.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I remember where I was a year ago,” she said in an interview with The New York Times.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: And she spent months in the tunnels, sometimes crammed with other female hostages in what she described as a small “cage.”

Ms. Damari studied those who held her and quickly learned who was against whom, and whom she could ask for what.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I was not going to be a victim,” she said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: When she was taken for treatment soon after her abduction to a hospital she identified as Shifa, Gaza’s largest medical center, a man introduced himself as “Dr.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Hamas,” she said, before anesthetizing her and amputating her damaged fingers.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “He was surrounded by 15 armed terrorists,” she recalled.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “She looks at me and says, ‘Hey, Two Fingers!’” Ms. Damari recalled.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “She was injured in the left leg and right arm, and me in the right leg and left hand,” she said, describing their friendship as “something cosmic.”

After both women were freed in the last cease-fire, they remained together through the first months of rehabilitation.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: When Hamas let Ms. Damari go, they gave her a “certificate of release.” She keeps it in a drawer.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “There were days I would beg them for a cold glass of water,” she said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It happened beyond my control,” she said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “If I can somehow give people inspiration and hope, for me that’s a privilege.”

At the Maccabi game, the first since her return home a month earlier, she led a roaring crowd in singing the team’s anthem.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “My dream when I was there was to fly all over the world and share my story in all sorts of places,” she said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I feel guilty when I get on a plane, when I sit in a hotel,” she said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Emily Damari is not free.”

Ms. Damari is determined that Israel not fail the hostages still in Gaza.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “To get excited at the age of 27 about a pack of cards is absurd,” Ms. Damari said.
Speaker: Damari
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “But you have nothing in the world other than that pack.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: You held onto it with all your life.”

In Kfar Aza, Ms. Damari would often drink her morning coffee with the Berman twins,  but on their first day in Gaza, Gali Berman was taken away.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: As long as they remain captive, Ms. Damari said, “there’s no way I can say I am free.”

In May, Ms. Damari made her first trip abroad since her release, to Britain, where her mother, Mandy, was born and had taken her campaign on behalf of the hostages.
Speaker: Damari
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I came for solutions, not sympathy,” Mandy Damari said at a news conference in London after meeting senior politicians in December.
Speaker: Mandy Damari
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The fans greeted her with yellow balloons and chanted, “Emily Damari, she’s one of our own.”

In Britain, Ms. Damari visited her grandfather’s grave.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “People have to understand what happened here,” she said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I was one of 250, many of whom did not survive.”

Title: In Israel, Two-Year Anniversary of Oct. 7 Attack Is Quiet but Inescapable

Reported from: Tel Aviv

Language: English

=== ARTICLE ===
In Israel, Two-Year Anniversary of Oct. 7 Attack Is Quiet but Inescapable

The somber milestone comes with peace talks underway, hostages from the Hamas-led attack still in Gaza, more than 67,000 Palestinians dead and Israel more isolated than ever.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “If you were there, or someone in your family was there, or you only saw a video — it will be a lot of years of treatment,” she said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It was important for us as parents to bring them here, to remember, and to pray,” she said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Maybe, in a couple of days, the hostages will be free — we hope.”

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel acknowledged the anniversary in a statement issued after sundown.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Our bloodthirsty enemies have hurt us badly,” he said, “but they did not break us.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Before long, they discovered the enormous strength of the nation of Israel.”

The nighttime ceremony in Tel Aviv, funded by donations, began with a minute’s silence and included prayers, readings and performances by survivors of the assault, bereaved relatives and some of Israel’s most celebrated artists.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Hamas issued a statement Tuesday calling the Oct. 7 attack a “glorious crossing,” and a spokesman for the group, Fawzi Barhoum said the attack had “stirred the conscience” of people worldwide to support the Palestinian cause.
Speaker: Fawzi Barhoum
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Ahmed al-Haddad, 51, a Gaza resident who said he, his wife and their four children had been displaced five times, said their suffering had surpassed what his grandparents had told him about the Nakba, or “catastrophe,” when Palestinians were displaced in Israel’s war for independence.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “This war is the harshest, the most merciless,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It feels like history repeating itself, only harder.”

Back in Israel, a moment of silence in kibbutz Kfar Aza at 6:29 was anything but, as drones whined, helicopters flew overhead and explosions frequently ripped through the air.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: His voice dropped as he noted that “our Gali and Ziv” — two brothers from Kfar Aza still held hostage in Gaza — had yet to return home.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Some say what happened is receding into the distance, but for me, it’s stronger than ever,” said Nitzan Kaner, 37.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: On Tuesday morning, she said she had experienced a sleepless night: “I couldn’t stop thinking about what we went through.”

A few minutes away, hundreds of Israelis visited the site of the Nova music festival, where more than 300 people were killed.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I wish that all the world would see this and know what happened to us and that it is real,” she said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “But all the world is against us now.”

Roman Fourmann, whose stepdaughter Dana Petrenko, 23, was killed along with her boyfriend, stood with his family at a small memorial erected in their honor.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It feels no different today than when it happened two years ago,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We go to work, we keep on living.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: But we can’t shake the feeling that it’s still Oct. 7.”

Trump Calls on Israel to Stop Bombing Gaza After Hamas Agrees to Parts of Cease-Fire Plan

President Trump said he believed Hamas was “ready for a lasting peace” after the militant group offered to release hostages and discuss the U.S.-led peace proposal.
Speaker: President Trump
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: President Trump said on Friday evening that he believed Hamas was “ready for a lasting peace” in Gaza, and called on Israel to stop bombing the enclave so that Israeli hostages could be removed from it safely.
Speaker: President Trump
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Based on the Statement just issued by Hamas, I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE,” Mr. Trump wrote.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly!
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: This is not about Gaza alone, this is about long sought PEACE in the Middle East.”

Israel did not immediately make any public statements.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Hamas is discussing this plan with seriousness,” Mohammad Nazzal, a senior Hamas official, told Al Jazeera in an interview on Thursday.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: He added that Hamas had “comments” on the 20-point plan and was looking for “gray areas” it could work with.
Speaker: He
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Most of the rest are surrounded and MILITARILY TRAPPED, just waiting for me to give the word, ‘GO,’ for their lives to be quickly extinguished,” he wrote.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I am asking that all innocent Palestinians immediately leave this area of potentially great future death for safer parts of Gaza,” Mr. Trump added.
Speaker: Trump
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Everyone will be well cared for by those that are waiting to help.”

For many people living in Gaza, uprooting would be difficult or impossible.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: After Mr. Trump unveiled the proposal at the White House, he told reporters in Washington that the moment was “potentially one of the great days ever in civilization.”

Title: They Have Waited Two Years for the Hostages.

TÉMOIGNAGE: Omri Miran, 48, who was kidnapped at Kibbutz Nahal Oz

His wife and children read “Goodnight Moon” and say good night to Daddy.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Each night, Omri’s wife, Lishay, reads “Goodnight Moon,” the book Omri once read to his daughters Roni, now 5, and Alma, 2½.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Lishay said her daughter asked “to go outside and say to the moon and to the trees and to the flowers: ‘Good night.’”

“After a few days she asked, could she also say good night to Daddy because he is not here?
Speaker: Lishay
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: So we started to say to Omri, ‘Good night, Daddy, we miss you and we love you’ — this is something we do every day,” Lishay said.
Speaker: Lishay
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: They send “unconditional love” and “light” to Alon, Idit said.
Speaker: Idit
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “After you lose your freedom, the sea is like a symbol,” Eli said, “a great symbol for freedom and open space.”

Upon his return, Eli learned that his wife and two daughters had been murdered on Oct. 7.
Speaker: Eli
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: They “are with me every day of my life, and every moment, but they are alongside of my life, not instead of my life,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: At night Elkana’s wife, Rivka, and their son, Re’em, 5, take out what they call a “box of memory, a box of waiting.” In it are photos of Elkana with the family.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It is a box where we keep our hope,” the Colombian-born Rivka said in Spanish.
Speaker: Rivka
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: She describes Elkana as “a man with dreams.”

Since Elkana’s abduction, Rivka has stopped working.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Now,” Salem said, “they train alone.”

In 2024 the military gave the family video confirmation that Muhammad had been killed on Oct. 7, his body taken back to Gaza and dragged through the streets.
Speaker: Salem
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “When I wake up every day, the first thing I think about — I don’t think about work, or labor, or anything — the first thing I think about is my brother, how are we going to bring him and bury him,” Salem said.
Speaker: Salem
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I had to come here, to our home.
Speaker: Inconnu

Title: Optimism on Trump’s Gaza Plan, but No Guarantees.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Mr. Trump said Hamas’s answer showed it was “ready for a lasting PEACE” and exhorted Israel to immediately stop bombing Gaza to allow the deal to advance.
Speaker: Trump
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “This will happen either diplomatically, according to Trump’s plan, or militarily — at our hands,” he said on Saturday, adding, “This will be achieved the easy way or the hard way, but it will be achieved.”

What are the biggest sticking points?
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Please end this nightmare,” she said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Please make it happen.”

She was referring to a plan to end the war and bring home the hostages that President Trump unveiled last month, being discussed in Egypt this week.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Everyone wants it to happen,” President Trump said on Monday evening at a briefing in the White House, speaking of his peace proposal.
Speaker: President Trump
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Even Hamas.”

But much still remains unresolved.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Fox News Sunday that Hamas had “agreed to the president’s hostage release framework.”

Under that plan, the hostages will be exchanged for 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences and 1,700 Gazans jailed by Israel during the war.
Speaker: State Marco Rubio
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “They’re going over the list of both the Israeli hostages and also the political prisoners who will be released, and those talks are underway,” she said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “All sides of this conflict agree that this war needs to end,” she said, “and agree to the 20-point framework that President Trump proposed.” The talks, she added, were an “incredible achievement.”

On Friday, Hamas said it was willing to release the hostages.
Speaker: Hamas
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “When Hamas confirms, the Ceasefire will be IMMEDIATELY effective, the Hostages and Prisoner Exchange will begin, and we will create the conditions for the next phase of withdrawal,” he pledged.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “What gives you hope here is that at least there is now a framework for how all this can come to an end,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Ms. Leavitt on Monday declined to give a deadline for the discussions but said “the Administration is working very hard to move the ball forward as quickly as we can.”

=== ARTICLE ===

Two years after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, Israel is torn.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Every conversation ends with the 7th of October,” said Ola Metzger, who recently came back with her family.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It’s a heated debate,” he said, sitting in the bright kitchen of his newly constructed house.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I say demolish and rebuild.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: It’s time to move forward.”

But how?
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Mr. Trump, shrugging off more than a century of failed Western interventions in the Middle East, has proposed a form of tutelage over Gaza that posits prosperity “crafted by well-meaning international groups” as a “pathway” to peace.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: But Mr. Trump’s idea of turning Gaza into a coastal business emporium with “preferred tariff and access rates” and a marginal Palestinian role in governance seems at once demeaning to the people who live there and unlikely to work.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “This plan does not guarantee our rights as human beings with dignity,” Riwaa Abu Quta, a young Gazan woman who has been living in a tent in the coastal area of Al-Mawasi for more than a year, said in a telephone interview.She has lost her home, her job and her hopes since the war began.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It gives us the feeling that displacement will be our identity.”

Displacement and the quest for a homeland are, of course, intrinsic to the intertwined fates of Israelis and Palestinians.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “The Oct. 7 slaughter and seizure of hostages reinforced Holocaust associations for Israel, and for many Palestinians in Gaza, the war has been a new Nakba,” said Yuval Shany, a professor of international law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.“So narratives feed themselves in an endless loop.”

At the two-year mark of the greatest defeat in the country’s 77-year history, Israelis find themselves mentally and physically exhausted, and not only the 295,000 reservists who have been called up again and again.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: After repeated ugly brawls over lanes, the beachside Gordon swimming pool in Tel Aviv, established in 1956, sent a letter on Aug. 7 urging its members to “avoid any expression of physical or verbal aggression.”

Arab neighbors speak of an imperial Israel, but inside Israel there is no triumphal sense of regional military ascendancy.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “There is no history, as in America, of the rugged individual in Israel,” said Gershom Gorenberg, an Israeli author and historian.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “The mythology here is of the rugged commune, and it is that sense of shared responsibility that has been shattered.”

The Two Israels

The former defense minister and chief of staff of the Israeli military, a man once close to Mr. Netanyahu, was angry.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We have lost our way.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Eighty years after the Holocaust, we are talking about ethnic cleansing, Jewish supremacy, clearing Gaza City of its inhabitants,” Moshe Yaalon told me.
Speaker: Moshe Yaalon
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Are these the values of the state of Israel?”

Tears welled up, and he had to pause.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I fought to defend the Jewish, democratic liberal state in the spirit of our Declaration of Independence,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “What we have now with this government is a tyrannical, racist, hateful, corrupt and boycotted leadership.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: That must be the main issue for the next election.”

The prime minister’s office declined to comment.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: They view him as the nation’s savior who, through a war of “resurrection,” as he calls it, has vanquished Hamas and made Israel safer.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Most Israeli prime ministers would probably have made the same decisions as Bibi,” said Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States and deputy minister in Mr. Netanyahu’s office, calling the prime minister by his nickname.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “He may have no credibility in the world, but he saw Oct. 7 as a summons to history and stepped up.”

The price has been high.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The first, a growing Messianic religious movement, now a decisive presence in the government, sees the Oct. 7 massacre of an estimated 1,200 people as a “miraculous moment that forced the Jewish nation to take another step toward redemption,” as Daniella Weiss, a prominent leader of the settler movement, put it to me.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: This calls for “complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants, irrespective of religion, race or sex.”

That lofty goal has proved unattainable in a Jewish state where two million citizens, or 20 percent of the population, are Arab or Palestinian.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Bibi has done terrible things not only to Palestinians, but to us,” said Gadi Shamni, a retired major general and a former Israeli military attaché in Washington.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “He has thrown away our basic values, of sanctifying life and of ethics in war, for which we sometimes paid a heavy price.”

Mr. Shamni said that, “with ministers demanding that we act as war criminals,” officers confronting a shadowy enemy embedded in Gaza’s civilian urban fabric had struggled to uphold values considered sacrosanct during his own time in the military.
Speaker: Shamni
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Itamar Ben-Gvir, the minister of national security, a man convicted several times of inciting racism, has suggested that not even “a gram of food or aid should get into Gaza,” and has called for “the clearing of one million people out of there” through “voluntary immigration.”

Bezalel Smotrich, the hard-line Israeli finance minister, has called for “total annihilation” in Gaza.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “They are to be destroyed, destroyed, destroyed,” he said last year.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I felt they were uprooting my own heart,” said Aisha Abu Alia, 53, as she stood in the fields gazing at the devastation.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Over the course of her life, Ms. Abu Alia said, she had experienced ever greater pressure and humiliation, aimed at “throwing out every Palestinian from this land.”

Unmarried, because “I know many people who got married and regretted it,” Ms. Abu Alia lives in her parents’ house.
Speaker: Abu Alia
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “But it’s impossible to leave,” she said, as if stating an evident truth.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Never.”

Her house commands a view of the village and the fields beyond it where settlers bring their sheep to graze, as well as of the main road, and so it has been requisitioned several times by the Israeli military.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: An officer explained that she lived in a “terrorist neighborhood.”

“Why don’t you love Israel?” he asked, as Ms. Abu Alia recalled.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Why don’t you love Palestine?” she responded.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “There is no such thing as Palestine,” the officer said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “With God’s will, one day there will be a Palestine and no Israel,” she said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I did not celebrate, even if we did not feel anything for the Israeli victims because we have had so many dead,” she said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I knew our lives would be turned upside down.”

Her 17-year-old niece, Sara, interjected: “Even if it had not happened, Israel would have done something like this.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: It just put everything into fast forward.”

“Gaza spilled over,” said Samar, Ms. Abu Alia’s cousin, pausing in her embroidery.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We lost homes, we lost trees, we lost many of our own.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Our children are traumatized.”

Her 8-year-old daughter, Nour, wearing a purple T-shirt emblazoned with the words, “Be a Younicorn,” smiled bravely, a portrait of innocence.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I don’t see any possibility whatsoever of a two-state solution,” Shlomo Ben-Ami, a former Israeli foreign minister, told me.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “There is too much history here now and too little geography.”

Israel, Hostage

Viki Cohen fondled the charred Rubik’s Cube found in the disabled tank from which, on Oct. 7, 2023, her then 19-year-old son Nimrod was dragged by masked Hamas operatives into Gaza.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Every few months, Ms. Cohen and her husband, Yehuda, have received “signs of life” communications from the Israeli military.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “He loved the Rubik’s Cube,” said Ms. Cohen, who used to work for a company providing caregivers for the aged, but quit more than a year ago.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “All my time goes to bringing Nimrod back home.”

Israel, for two years now, has been taken hostage.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We hope it’s a matter of days,” Mr. Cohen said, after hearing that Hamas had agreed to free all of the hostages.
Speaker: Cohen
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I can’t talk now, I am counting the minutes and even the seconds,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I have to take care of my son.”

The nation is on tenterhooks.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: In an earlier interview, Mr. Cohen, an algorithmic engineer in a tech company, wore a black T-shirt with the words, “Ceasefire Hostage Deal Now.” Nimrod is a normal child, he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “He’s special to us because he’s our son.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: We’re only talking about him because he had the misfortune to be kidnapped, and we’re fulfilling our basic responsibility to fight for his release.”

His tone was matter-of-fact.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: This “now needless war” has been going on a long time, far too long in his view.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We are disgusted, we are frustrated,” Mr. Cohen said.
Speaker: Cohen
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We see Netanyahu’s government as our enemy.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: My son Nimrod is being held in a tunnel financed by money Netanyahu pushed into Gaza.”

He looked at me hard.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Everybody is to blame except him, except Caesar,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I don’t want my country to be a country that rules others,” Mr. Cohen said.
Speaker: Cohen
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I don’t want to live in a country whose international borders are not declared and recognized.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: I want to live in a normal country.”

‘The Place of Funerals’

Over several weeks, I spoke regularly by phone to Riwaa Abu Quta in Gaza.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: She is scared and angry, “as any human being would be.” She has tried to care for her younger sister Alaa, who has muscular dystrophy, but the required medicine long since disappeared.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Gaza, she said, has become “the place of funerals.” More than 66,000, according to the Gaza health authorities, who do not distinguish between combatants and civilians.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: She blames Israel above all for killing the innocent; Hamas for bringing disaster on the Palestinian people; and a feckless world that chooses this moment to recognize a Palestinian state when the step is “too late and so small compared to the destruction we live.”

Mutating Rage

At Kibbutz Nir Oz, the demolition of charred and damaged houses began on Aug. 31.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Backhoes were used to break down the “safe rooms,” the hardest to tear down, even if in many cases they proved anything but safe.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Yarden, we’re glad you’re back.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Sorry, forgive us,” says a message on the ruin that was his home.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Such slaughter revived Holocaust memories, mocked the “Never Again” embodied in Israel’s very creation, and so roused the country to a deep rage.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “After the Holocaust, it was unsavory to hate Jews,” said Mr. Oren, the former Israeli ambassador.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “But that period has ended, and the world has reverted to form.”

There is also a strong feeling, however, that the way Mr. Netanyahu prosecuted the war led Israel to a sustained brutality in Gaza that will haunt the nation for many years.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Mr. Gorenberg, the Israeli historian, rejected the accusation against Israel of “genocide,” noting that the term was first used in the very early weeks of the war when Hamas missiles were raining down on Tel Aviv, and so was evidently stained from the start with “an unjustifiable animus.”

However, he added, “There have been horrible, reprehensible war crimes in a war that at some point, I would say early 2024, ceased serving the purpose of defending Israel.”

This long war has transformed young Israelis from the TikTok generation to a cohort forged in a crucible of violence that has known few restraints.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Enough of blood and tears.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Enough,” Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel declared on the White House lawn 32 years ago in the time of hope that was the close of the 20th Century.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “There will be no Palestinian state west of the Jordan River,” Mr. Netanyahu said on Sunday.
Speaker: Netanyahu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “For years, I have prevented the establishment of this terrorist state facing tremendous pressures at home and abroad.”

Partitioning the territory between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea has long been a proposed solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: On Monday, its prime minister said his country was joining the movement, but that it would not “legally recognize” the state until Hamas released the Israeli hostages and is removed from Palestine.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The way Israel detains those prisoners “effectively erases these individuals from public awareness and strips them of fundamental rights,” said Nadine Abu Arafeh, a lawyer who has represented detainees from Gaza in other cases in Israeli courts.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Families in Gaza live with questions: Are their loved ones alive?”

Israel’s Justice Ministry declined to comment.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “They don’t want that discourse,” she said of the government.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: All of the roughly 2,700 Palestinians detainees who were rounded up in Gaza over the course of the war are designated as “unlawful combatants,” which, according to Israeli law, means they can be held without charge or trial.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Under the terms of a cease-fire earlier this year, Israel released about 1,000 of the “unlawful combatants” to Gaza, in addition to women and minors detained in Gaza over the course of the war.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The lengthy detention of so many people without trial “risks becoming a life sentence without the usual protections of the criminal process,” said Monica Hakimi, a Columbia Law School professor and an expert on international law.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The Israeli military denied that “systemic abuse” had happened in a base where thousands of Gazan detainees had been held earlier in the war.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The Shin Bet, Israel’s domestic intelligence agency, said that all of its interrogations were “conducted in accordance with the law.”

In February, the Israeli military charged at least five soldiers who served in that base with abuse of a detainee.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I won’t forget the murders and horrors,” Mr. Ben-Gvir said in one of the videos, suggesting that the prisoners were connected to the attack.
Speaker: Gvir
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Look at them now, how cowardly they are.”

In late July, Israeli lawmakers extended emergency provisions that allow the ongoing detentions of prisoners suspected of involvement in the attack in detention awaiting prosecution through January 2026 — an indication that they may not face charges for at least six more months.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “This is a problem,” Mr. Rothman told lawmakers before the extensions.
Speaker: Rothman
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It’s a malfunction.”

=== ARTICLE ===

In Oct. 7 Report, Israeli Security Agency Puts Some Blame on Netanyahu Government

The Shin Bet said that it had disregarded intelligence from Gaza about a planned Hamas raid, but also that government policies may have emboldened the militants to attack.
Speaker: The Shin Bet
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I am not deterred by fabricated investigations and a political manhunt,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I will continue to insist on the truth.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: I will continue to demand a balanced commission of inquiry that will reach the truth.”

Mr. Netanyahu’s resistance to an inquiry and to calls for his resignation contrasts with the actions of some other Israeli officials.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The departing military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, who is resigning this month, has taken responsibility for what he called his “terrible failure” to prevent the attack.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “This is not the standard that we expected from ourselves and the public from us,” the agency said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: And it pointed to government reluctance to undertake “offensive” initiatives, including targeting Hamas leaders in Gaza.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The agency also cited the treatment of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli detention and “the perception that Israeli society has weakened.” Before the attack, Mr. Netanyahu advanced a plan to overhaul Israel’s judiciary, setting off protests nationwide, and many Israelis have blamed Mr. Netanyahu for the Hamas attack, citing domestic unrest as a factor that emboldened the militants.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The Israeli news media reported that the office released an unofficial statement to a small group of local reporters that was “attributed to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s inner circle.” That statement said the intelligence agency had presented “an ‘investigation’ that answers no questions” and did not correspond to “the magnitude of the organization’s enormous failure.”

The prime minister’s office laid out a series of failures by intelligence agents, including an assessment presented just days before the attack “definitively stating” that Hamas wanted to avoid a campaign against Israel.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “The head of the Shin Bet did not see fit to wake the prime minister on the night of the attack — the most basic and obvious decision one could imagine,” it said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Briefing reporters the day before publishing some of their initial findings, Israeli military officials, who could not be named under army rules, suggested that the failure stemmed from flawed assumptions about Hamas’s capabilities and intentions, as well as what some military officials have called an “addiction” to precise intelligence, which was lacking.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The military acknowledged reports that it had found a Hamas operational invasion plan code-named “Jericho Wall” by 2022, which it says was initially conceived in 2016.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: In a written summary of some of the main findings, the military said that “the information was generally misinterpreted as an unrealistic or unfeasible plan.”

Before Oct. 7, the military assessed that the threat posed by Hamas amounted to a limited number of raids at four to eight points along the border, not the dozens seen during the assault, and that any such attack would involve dozens of militants, not thousands.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Amir Tibon, an Israeli journalist and resident of one of the villages, Nahal Oz, praised the military’s inquiry as “in-depth and serious.”

He said he “felt it touched on all the difficult points, without any whitewashing.” But he added that it was essentially a tactical report that could not replace the need for a full independent commission of inquiry.
Speaker: He
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Mr. Tibon, the author of a recent book, “The Gates of Gaza,” about his family’s ordeal on Oct. 7 and the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict, said the military inquiry had provided him with some new details of what he described as “the heroic battle for the defense of Nahal Oz,” though not many.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: One thing he learned, he said, was that three waves of assailants had entered his village, not two, as he had previously thought, and that the third one arrived at about 11 a.m.

“That shows the absolute madness of how long it took for the army to manage to get organized and to send a large force to rescue us,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Hamas has declared “victory” over Israel, and some of its officials have vowed that their fighters will carry out more Oct. 7-style attacks in the future.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Knowing of the consequences, he said, would have made it “impossible” for him to back the assault.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “If it was expected that what happened would happen, there wouldn’t have been Oct. 7,” as far as he was concerned, he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: In a statement posted after publication, Hamas said that the comments The Times attributed to Mr. Abu Marzouk were “incorrect” and taken out of context.
Speaker: Hamas
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: It also said the senior Hamas official called the Oct. 7 attack “an expression of our people’s right to resistance and of its rejection of the siege, occupation and settlement building.”

The statement added that Mr. Abu Marzouk affirmed the group’s position that “the weapons of the resistance” can’t be given up as long as “there is an occupation of our land.”

His comments suggest that there are differences among Hamas officials over the party line on Oct. 7 and its consequences.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “He’s not a nihilist,” said Stanley Cohen, a lawyer and longtime friend of Mr. Abu Marzouk based in New York.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “He would not support any action that he believed would bring unprecedented, wholesale retaliation by anyone on the people.”

Mr. Abu Marzouk said that Hamas’s survival in the war against Israel was itself a “kind of victory.” He also likened Hamas to an average person fighting Mike Tyson, the former heavyweight boxing champion: if the untrained novice survived Mr. Tyson’s punches, people would say he was victorious, he said.
Speaker: Abu Marzouk
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: In absolute terms, he said it would be “unacceptable” to claim Hamas won, especially considering the scale of what Israel inflicted on Gaza.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We’re talking about a party that lost control of itself and took revenge against everything,” he said, referring to Israel.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “That is not a victory under any circumstances.”

The Israeli military has claimed that it has conducted its air and ground campaigns in Gaza in accordance with international law, and that it was carrying out attacks against Hamas, which the United States and other countries have designated a terrorist group.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We are ready to speak about every issue,” he said, when asked about the weapons.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Any issue that is put on the table, we need to speak about it.”

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has insisted that his country will not end the war with Hamas without dismantling the group’s governing and military capabilities.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Mr. Abu Marzouk’s remarks appeared to contradict those of Osama Hamdan, another Hamas official, who told a conference in Doha, Qatar, in the middle of this month that “the weapons of the resistance” were not up for discussion, seeming to rule out a compromise.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We’re ready to have a comprehensive deal,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: In a statement, the group — which represents journalists working for the international press in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, including The New York Times — called the situation “beyond absurd.”

“These repeated delays have robbed the world of a fuller glimpse of conditions in Gaza and made a mockery of the entire legal process,” the association said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Since the war began, Israel has prevented our international journalists from entering Gaza except when accompanied by the military, limiting reporting on the ground that is vital to understanding the conflict and assuring the free and credible flow of information,” a spokeswoman for The Times said.
Speaker: The Times
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “The Times has supported appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court for safe and increased access to Gaza, and we call on Israel to lift restrictions without delay, allowing all journalists to work securely and without fear or hesitation.”

The Israeli military has allowed international reporters to enter Gaza  on a limited number of tightly controlled visits accompanied by Israeli forces.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: She called the ban on the entry of international journalists “a deliberate barrier to accountability.”

Some critics also contend that the ban makes it harder to investigate reports of abuses by Hamas, such as the Palestinian group’s bloody reprisals against its opponents.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The Israeli government told the Supreme Court in late October that it was planning on “re-examining its policy on the entry of journalists” within 30 days, in light of the truce, according to court filings.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Jonathan Conricus, a former senior spokesman for the Israeli military, said Israel should have begun easing the ban “more than a year ago, and definitely since the cease-fire.”

The policy made sense in the first months of the war, given the scope of the fighting in Gaza, he said in an interview, but that position became untenable as the conflict dragged on.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Today, I think there is very little logic left,” said Mr. Conricus, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based think tank.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I think it is self-defeating and does not serve any clear purpose for the State of Israel.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: At this stage, I think it is harmful.”

Jerusalem Authorities Raid UNRWA Compound and Raise Israeli Flag

Municipal officials say the action was about unpaid taxes.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “To allow this represents a new challenge to international law, one that creates a dangerous precedent anywhere else the U.N. is present across the world,” he wrote on social media.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: He accused Israel of violating the Convention on the Privileges & Immunities of the United Nations, which makes the organization’s premises “inviolable” and its property and assets “immune from legal process.”

The Israeli police and municipal officials “forcibly entered” the compound in East Jerusalem with trucks and forklifts, he said, cut off communications and seized furniture, tech equipment and other property.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: In a statement, the municipality said that UNRWA had accumulated about $3.4 million dollars in property tax debt “that had not been paid for a long period of time,” and that calls for action had gone ignored by the agency before the operation.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “This is a substantial debt that needs to be collected after repeated requests, warnings and numerous opportunities to settle it, which were not responded to,” the municipality said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “There’s coordination on the level of security, and on the operations around us,” he said, and added, “These aim to prevent any terrorist from infiltrating us,” referring to Hamas.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: But Gaza’s Hamas-run interior ministry celebrated his death in a statement on Friday, saying it was “the inevitable fate of every traitor,” and urged the remaining members of Palestinian militias close to Israel to hand themselves in, “before it is too late.”

Whether the Popular Forces will outlast his death is unclear.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “They carry out military missions as though they were a military unit,” Mr. Ben Hanan said.
Speaker: Ben Hanan
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “If they weren’t around to do them, our own forces would have to.”

But for most Palestinians, Mr. Abu Shabab’s checkered past and ties with Israel made him an unacceptable candidate for any future leadership role in Gaza.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Georgios Petropoulos, a senior U.N. official who was based in Gaza at the time, called him “the self-styled power broker of east Rafah.” Mr. Petropoulos, as well as other U.N. workers trying to get aid into Gaza, accused Israel of ignoring Mr. Abu Shabab’s attacks on aid.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Earlier this year, Mr. Abu Shabab began touting himself as a Palestinian leader on social media, calling his band of gunmen an anti-Hamas “counterterrorism force.” He released footage that appeared to show that, in the corner of Rafah that he ruled, the group provided tents and schools for people sheltering there.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “They will always be considered traitors and collaborators,” Mr. Ben Hanan said.
Speaker: Ben Hanan
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “No one will want to get close to them.”

Many Gazans view the militias as little better than gangs who exploited the chaos of war to accumulate power.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “This man was basically a criminal, and I could not accept for him to represent me,” Mr. Bahja said.
Speaker: Bahja
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: He dismissed accusations that he was a traitor for working with Israel, though he conceded that some Palestinians considered his actions “disreputable.”

He said that if they “had will and courage, they would have been like Yasser Abu Shabab.”

Title: Judge Dismisses Harvard Antisemitism Lawsuit by a Former Student

Judge Dismisses Harvard Antisemitism Lawsuit by a Former Student

Yoav Segev said he was harassed “for being Jewish and Israeli” during a campus protest in October 2023, an episode that had drawn the attention of Republicans in Washington.
Speaker: He
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Judge Richard G. Stearns of the Federal District Court in Boston said that Yoav Segev, who sued the university soon after completing his master’s program at Harvard Business School, “has not shown that he experienced severe and pervasive racial harassment.”

Mr. Segev’s complaint dated back to a well-publicized episode on campus in October 2023, when he was a student, during a “die-in” protest on the grass in front of the business school.
Speaker: Boston
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Video of the protest showed that he was quickly surrounded by other students, who yelled “shame!” and tried to block his camera lens with scarves.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: In his complaint, Mr. Segev said that he was “physically assaulted by an antisemitic mob,” and that he was yelled at “for being Jewish and Israeli.” Mr. Segev had accused Harvard officials of refusing “to take any reasonable action” to punish the students involved or offer Mr. Segev any redress.
Speaker: Segev
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The lawsuit also accused the university of conducting a “sham investigation” of what happened.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: In his ruling, Judge Stearns wrote that “while the court does not condone an assault on a fellow student by campus protesters,” nothing in Mr. Segev’s complaint “plausibly supports the notion that his assailants’ conduct was motivated by race-based antisemitism.”

A spokesman for Harvard declined to comment Thursday evening.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: In June, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said that the Israeli government “activated” clans in Gaza opposed to Hamas at the advice of security officials.
Speaker: Israel
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “What’s bad about it?” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It’s only good, and it only saves the lives of Israel Defense Force soldiers.”

Allegations that Mr. Abu Shabab stole scores of aid trucks earned him a notorious reputation among Palestinians.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Georgios Petropoulos, a senior United Nations official who was based in Gaza at the time, called him “the self-styled power broker of east Rafah.”

In an interview in November 2024, Mr. Abu Shabab, thin and lightly bearded, denied he had looted a large number of aid trucks.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We are taking trucks so we can eat, not so we can sell,” he said, asserting that he was feeding his family and neighbors.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Every hungry person is taking aid.” He accused Hamas of being primarily responsible for stealing the aid, an accusation that Hamas has denied.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Shortly after takeoff from Istanbul after completing the first leg of his inaugural international trip, Pope Leo XIV said he had spoken with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey about serving as a “mediating voice” to help Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories negotiate a two-state solution.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We all know that right now Israel does not accept this situation,” the pope said, speaking in Italian in response to a Turkish reporter’s question about the Vatican’s position on the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Leo, noting that the Vatican is “also friends with Israel,” said a two-state solution was “the only solution” to “the conflict they continually live.” He added, “Turkey has an important role that it can play in this.”

The pope’s answer was in accordance with longstanding Vatican policy.
Speaker: He
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: In October, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Holy See’s Secretary of State, said Israel was conducting a “massacre” in Gaza as retribution for Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Cardinal Parolin described those attacks as an “inhuman massacre.” After the Israeli government objected to Cardinal Parolin’s comments, Pope Leo said that the cardinal “expressed the Holy See’s opinion in this matter very well.”

Leo, who thanked President Erdogan for the use of his personal helicopter, said on the plane that the Turkish leader had spent many months talking with the presidents of Russia and Ukraine to try to resolve the war in Ukraine.
Speaker: Pope Leo
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Leo said he hoped that, given President Erdogan’s relationships with the leaders of Russia, Ukraine and the United States, which is trying to broker a cease-fire, the Turkish president could help “promote dialogue” that would lead to a cease-fire and ultimately an end to the war.
Speaker: Leo
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: On the plane, Leo said that Turkey was a country where, although Christians are a very small minority, “people of different religions are able to live in peace.” Speaking in English, he described Turkey as an example of “what we all would be looking for throughout the world — that in spite of religious differences, in spite of ethnic differences, in spite of many other differences, people can indeed live in peace.”

As the plane descended toward Beirut for the start of the pope’s two-and-a-half day visit, reporters on board spotted fighter jets off both wings of the Airbus 320 that had been rented for the papal trip.
Speaker: Leo
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We implore you to tell the world that we shall not die, nor leave, nor despair, nor surrender,” President Aoun said, addressing the pope.
Speaker: President Aoun
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We will stay here, breathe freedom, invent joy, perfect love, cherish innovation, embrace modernity and create every day a life worth living.”

In his remarks, Pope Leo encouraged the Lebanese to stay, despite economic, political and security concerns.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “There are times when it is easier to flee, or simply more convenient to move elsewhere,” Pope Leo said.
Speaker: Pope Leo
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It takes real courage and foresight to stay or return to one’s own country, and to consider even somewhat difficult situations worthy of love and dedication.”

He acknowledged the violence and poverty that could drive young people in particular to emigrate, and the value of building a diaspora, but said that “we must not forget that remaining in our homeland and working day by day to develop a civilization of love and peace remains something very valuable.”

Netanyahu Says He Is Undaunted by Legal Woes at Home and Threats of Arrest by New York’s Mayor-Elect

Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Wednesday that he would not hesitate to visit New York, despite a pledge by the city’s mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, to honor an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I’ll come to New York,” Mr. Netanyahu said, adding, “Yes, of course I will.”

But the I.C.C.
Speaker: Netanyahu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I’m supposed to spend three times a week, eight hours a week in that trial,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “And, you know, I’ve got a few other things to do.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: And I think history beckons.”

This week, Mr. Netanyahu asked Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog — whose role is mostly ceremonial — to “end” his trial.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The prime minister was following the lead of President Trump, who has on multiple occasions suggested that Mr. Herzog should preemptively “pardon” Mr. Netanyahu.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: He has not asked for a “pardon” or anything that would suggest he has done something that must be forgiven.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “They don’t want justice,” he said of his accusers.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “They want me out of office.”

While Mr. Netanyahu has spoken to Mr. Trump about Mr. Netanyahu’s request to Mr. Herzog, he declined to share details of that conversation or to speculate on whether Israel’s president would grant his wish.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “President Trump spoke time and time again about the need to end this, what he calls a ‘witch hunt,’” Mr. Netanyahu said.
Speaker: Netanyahu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It’s a joke,” Mr. Netanyahu said of the trial.
Speaker: Netanyahu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “When history is within reach, you don’t step aside, you step forward, and that is what I am doing,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The region is adapting to what Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a prominent political scientist in the United Arab Emirates, calls an “imperial Israel,” a country whose defense forces operate almost at will in the air and on the ground, and will kill enemies anywhere: from Lebanon to Syria, Gaza to Iran, Yemen to Qatar.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “The Israelis say they can’t leave unless Hezbollah disarms, and Hezbollah says how can we disarm as long as the Israelis don’t?” Nawaf Salam, the Lebanese prime minister, told me in an interview.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Hezbollah knows things have changed in the region but are still trying to resist.”

Each death inflicted by Israel seems only to fortify the resolve of its enemies, no matter how weakened, and erode any impulse for peace.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: A Hezbollah billboard on the coastal highway said it all: “When we are victorious, we win, and when we are martyred, we win.”

Lebanon exists in a gray zone between war and peace.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I fear we’ll see a major Israeli escalation, further undermining the very best president and prime minister Lebanon has had in decades,” said Jeffrey Feltman, a former U.S. ambassador to Lebanon.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The Iran-led “axis of resistance,” of which Hezbollah has been a central part, is a shadow of its former self.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: In a one-page letter that he himself signed, he did not use the word “pardon,” instead stiffly requesting an “end of the trial.” It came a little more than two weeks after President Trump sent a letter to Mr. Herzog urging him to pardon Mr. Netanyahu.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Naftali Bennett, who served a year as prime minister in 2021 and is planning a comeback in the next election, supported a pardon as long as it came with Mr. Netanyahu’s “respectful retirement from political life.”

The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, declared that the president could not legally pardon Mr. Netanyahu “without an admission of guilt, an expression of remorse and an immediate retirement from political life.”

Reuven Hazan, a political science professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said that Mr. Netanyahu’s request was intended to distract.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “He threw this out there to have us do what we’re doing right now, which is talk about this and not those other issues,” Mr. Hazan said.
Speaker: Hazan
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “He moves the agenda.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: And there’s no one in Israeli politics that can do it as well as he can.”

There also may be no one in Israeli politics with as much chutzpah.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “My personal interest was to continue the process to its end, until full acquittal on all charges,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “But the security and political reality, the national interest — these require otherwise.”

Of course, for two years, Mr. Netanyahu said he was too busy prosecuting Israel’s war in Gaza to be bothered defending himself against prosecution on graft and breach of trust charges.
Speaker: Netanyahu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: But his lawyers instead pointed to unspecified “golden opportunities” for Israel in the Middle East.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: This was presumably an allusion to expanding the Abraham Accords to include normalization with Saudi Arabia, a much-dangled possibility — if only the prime minister were “able to devote all of his time and energy” to capitalizing on it.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: In the video on Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu warned that going ahead with his trial “tears us apart from within, fuels fierce disputes and deepens rifts.” He suggested that aborting it would “greatly help lower the flames and advance the broad reconciliation our country so urgently needs.”

Mitchell Barak, an Israeli pollster who worked for Mr. Netanyahu in the 1990s, called the reference to societal rifts laughable.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “He’s the one that caused the divisiveness, and he continues to cause it,” Mr. Barak said.
Speaker: Barak
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “The whole letter is written in a way that allows him to campaign on this if he’s not given a pardon,” Professor Hazan said.
Speaker: Professor Hazan
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: In fact, in their zeal to make every plausible argument for a pardon, Mr. Netanyahu’s lawyers invoked an Israeli law that offered amnesty to some people convicted of nonviolent crimes, in which special consideration was to be given to those who “contributed to the security and resilience of the state,” especially in the two-year war against Hamas.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Mr. Trump wrote to Mr. Herzog two weeks ago urging that he “fully pardon” Mr. Netanyahu and calling the case against him a “political, unjustified prosecution.”

Mr. Netanyahu cited Mr. Trump’s appeal to Mr. Herzog in his video statement on Sunday.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “This is his main argument: that Trump has put forward the letter which Bibi, of course, asked him to put forward,” she said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “So he leans on Trump to excuse his own behavior.”

Segev Kalfon said he endured physical abuse and mind games during 738 days in the hands of Hamas.
Speaker: Segev Kalfon

TÉMOIGNAGE: “He pointed a Kalashnikov rifle to my head and asked, ‘Should you be first?’”

Mr. Kalfon said he persuaded the burly commander to spare him.

Title: Eli Zeira, 97, Dies; Israeli Official Dismissed Warnings of Yom Kippur War
Authors: Richard Sandomir, Johnatan Reiss
Published: Nov. 26, 2025

=== ARTICLE ===

Eli Zeira, 97, Dies; Israeli Official Dismissed Warnings of Yom Kippur War

As Israel’s head of military intelligence, he disregarded signs Egypt and Syria were about to attack in 1973.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: A few months after that war ended, General Zeira described Israelis as “tension addicts,” able to live in a state of perpetually charged uncertainty.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We know why we live in Israel,” he said in a speech to a Rotary Club in Houston.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It has always been this way.”

In April 1973, Ashraf Marwan, son-in-law of former President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt and who was believed to be a spy for Israel, told the Mossad, Israel’s spy agency, that Egypt and Syria would attack in mid-May.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: They told the Israeli cabinet that there was a “very low probability of an attack,” according to a 2017 reconstruction of prewar intelligence failures by the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington.
Speaker: They
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: General Zeira, who had contempt for Egypt and Syria’s military capabilities, said at the time, “A logical analysis of the situation will show that the Egyptians would make a mistake if they went to war.”

Israel nonetheless responded by calling up tens of thousands of reservists and sending brigades to the Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Even when Egypt began a major military exercise on the Suez Canal on Oct. 1, General Zeira still described the likelihood of an attack as “very low.”

At a general staff meeting, he said he had received a report from a Mossad agent at 2:30 a.m. that the exercise would end with an invasion across the canal.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: In his 2003 book “The Eve of Destruction: The Untold Story of the Yom Kippur War,” the journalist and author Howard Blum quoted General Zeira as saying at the time, “Since there’s no war today, I think you will agree that I did the right thing by not awaking anyone in the middle of the night.”

On Oct. 5, Mr. Marwan told Zvi Zamir, the director of the Mossad, that the Egyptians would attack the next day at sunset — right at the start of Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.
Speaker: Marwan
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: He told Lt. Gen. David Elazar, the I.D.F.’s chief of staff, “On the basis of messages from Zvika, you do not mobilize a whole army,” referring to Mr. Zamir.
Speaker: He
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “He was highly regarded by both his superiors and subordinates and often was mentioned as a future chief of staff,” the journalist Abraham Rabinovichwrote in Newsday in 1974, soon after the release of a report by the Agranat Commission, which was formed by Israel to determine responsibility for the military’s lack of preparedness before the Yom Kippur War.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The commission blamed General Zeira and General Shalev for a “totally insufficient warning” and “grave failures” in interpreting intelligence.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: General Zeira was “one of those responsible, a leading one,” Mr. Gelber said, but he “took the hit for everyone.”

General Zeira subsequently left the I.D.F.
Speaker: Gelber
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: In a conversation with Aviram Barkai, a historian who wrote “For Heaven’s Sake: Squadron 201 and the Yom Kippur War” (2017), General Zeira said his inaction before the war constituted “my life’s biggest mistake.”

In Mr. Barkai’s latest book, “And the Lightning Struck Twice: October 1973-October 2023,” published earlier this year, General Zeira reflected on the similarities in lack of preparedness between the Yom Kippur War and the terrorist attacks by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed more than 1,200 Israelis, igniting the Israeli war in Gaza.
Speaker: General Zeira
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Whoever sought to surprise us succeeded,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “The Israelis say they can’t leave unless Hezbollah disarms, and Hezbollah says how can we disarm as long as the Israelis don’t?” Nawaf Salam, the Lebanese prime minister, said in an interview.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Hezbollah knows things have changed in the region but are still trying to resist.”

A morass of mistrust had now led to a dangerous escalation, and the Trump administration’s target for Hezbollah to disarm completely by the end of the year looks implausible.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Democracy” is not part of President Trump’s lexicon.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The Iran-led “axis of resistance,” of which Hezbollah has been a central part, is a shadow of its former self.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The region is adapting to what Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a prominent political scientist in the United Arab Emirates, calls an “imperial Israel,” a country that will kill enemies anywhere: from Lebanon to Syria, Gaza to Iran, Yemen to Qatar.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Tom Barrack, the U. S. ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Lebanon and Syria, told me that if Israel senses any threat, “They’re going to respond anytime, anywhere.”

“When the Israelis find these guys, they just take them out, so you have two or three a week that are whacked,” he said of the strikes against Hezbollah.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The Israeli military said it had “eliminated” a “Hezbollah terrorist.”

A Hezbollah statement the next day read: “You are invited to participate in the blessed funeral procession of the happy martyr on the road to Jerusalem.”

‘Don’t Forget or Forgive’

Shlomi Hatan, a rifle slung over his shoulder, sat in the On-the-Border Café gazing across its green AstroTurf flooring at the Israeli side of the border wall.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Peace Train,” a Cat Stevens number, played on the sound system, loud enough to be heard on the other side of the wall, in Lebanon.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Murals and inscriptions with an unlikely theme of reconciliation and peace adorn the barrier, including a woman watering an olive tree and words from the Book of Isaiah: “They will beat swords into plowshares.”

Six years ago, in a moment of optimism, 10 artists came for a month to Shtula, a small Israeli farming community that abuts the Lebanese border.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We’re not going back to the situation before Oct. 7, with our enemy close to the fence,” Mr. Hatan said, pointing to the ruin of a Hezbollah observation tower.
Speaker: Hatan
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Our definition of suspicious movement is now very low and will draw an immediate response.”

Before the Oct. 7 attack, Israel was a nation lulled, he now believes.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The enemy, whether in Lebanon or Gaza, appeared deterred before “they took the masks off their faces,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Now, we will have to live by the sword for the next century,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Scratched on its wall beside a narrow loophole were the words: “Man.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Remember why you are here and what you are facing.”

The Uncompromising Hegemon
“The so-called cessation of hostilities,” as he put it, has been a frustration for Mr. Salam, the Lebanese prime minister.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We have an unchecked player acting as a hegemon under a leader, Netanyahu, growing stronger by the day,” Mr. Salam told me.
Speaker: Salam
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “At the same time there’s a new generation across the world that can no longer tolerate Israeli behavior.”

Israel pledged in the truce last year to withdraw from Lebanon within 60 days, but “stayed in five points on hilltops,” Mr. Salam said.
Speaker: Salam
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: He has raised this issue many times, including with Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers III, the American officer who was a leader of the “monitoring mechanism” of the cease-fire for several months, but to no avail.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I told him we are not in 1914 or 1915,” Mr. Salam said with exasperation.
Speaker: Salam
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “To monitor what goes on around you, you don’t need to be on top of a 700-meter hill with binoculars or a Galileo telescope!
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Israel has satellite imagery and drones and balloons with the most sophisticated cameras on earth.”

France, which oversees the cease-fire alongside the United States, formally demanded this month that Israel withdraw from the five positions, but the United States has not publicly pressed the issue.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “You cannot ask the army to do wonders when they lack the means, and the behavior of the Israeli side is undermining it,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “If you’re a soldier in the Lebanese army earning $300 a month, you have to have three jobs.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: You’re an Uber driver, a barista and a soldier,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “So you go knock on a Shia door on Mondays and say, ‘I’m sorry, man, can I go into your basement and take out the AK-47s?’ And you’re risking your life.”

Still, he added, “We’ve got to have just one army” in Lebanon.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Israel will be humiliated!
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: We are far from humiliation!”

The cries rose from a Hezbollah crowd of about 1,000 people gathered in a giant hangar during our visit in September.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: A Hezbollah billboard on the coastal highway said it all: “When we are victorious, we win, and when we are martyred, we win.”

A deep crater in Dahiya, where Israeli bombs killed Mr. Nasrallah, has been left almost untouched.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: A billboard says, “I won’t abandon you.”

“The enemy is still the same enemy, and the perpetrator of the massacres is the same,” Mr. Qassem declared.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “So how can we abandon weapons?
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: From now until the Judgment Day, they will remain!”

‘War Chases Us’

Lebanon’s south has long been Hezbollah’s stronghold and the crossroads of conflict with Israel.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “No,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I have to be with my people through good times and bad.”

Nabatieh and the surrounding area continue to be hit by intermittent Israeli strikes, killing people and heightening the sense that the cease-fire is even less stable than Lebanon’s battered buildings.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Everything is being done to accommodate Israeli aggression and make it easy for Israel to stay,” Mr. al-Din said, spreading his arms in bewilderment.
Speaker: Din
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “What has happened to humanity among the regimes of the world?”

Hezbollah, he continued, now faces two enemies: Israel and a hostile regime in Syria, which once provided essential support.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Syria was a big loss, some Hezbollah people say we lost everything,” the mayor, a Hezbollah sympathizer but not a member, said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “So we have two fears, to the south and to the east, and are asked to disarm!”

Farther south, adjacent to the Israeli border, the town of Khiam offers a portrait of the widespread devastation found in the area.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Khaled Moussa, 23, a Syrian refugee who said he fled from the Syrian civil war at the age of 10 “carried on the neck of my father,” sipped a thick grainy coffee at a solitary street stand.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “War chases us,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: They “can ignite the whole area again if it serves them,” including in Lebanon, she said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: But as the war in Gaza dragged on for two years, she recoiled from talk by the extreme right of there being “no innocent people in Gaza” and of “death to Arabs,” which, she noted, would mean killing Arab citizens of Israel, who constitute one-fifth of the population.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Once your government does things that contradict your morals and your very basic feelings and thoughts and ideas and principles, it shatters the soul,” she told me.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It does something awful.”

Unlike Mr. Hatan, 35 miles southwest on the same Lebanese border, she is appalled by Mr. Netanyahu and what a militant Israel has become.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: On Nov. 2, he said, “We will not allow Lebanon to become a renewed front against us and will act as necessary.”

Peace May Be Overrated

Mr. Barrack, the American envoy, invited me onto the terrace of the U.S. ambassador’s residence in Istanbul, which overlooks the Bosporus.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: A realist with a can-do briskness, a Californian descended from Lebanese Christian immigrants, he is skeptical of the word “peace,” which he considers illusory or at best temporary in an environment of deep wounds.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It’s not the land you hold,” he told me, “it’s the way you live.”

In states like Lebanon and Syria, people have been killing each other for too long over what he called “facts that don’t matter any more.” Mr. Barrack wants a “timeout.”

“How many more generations do you want to kill each other?” he asked.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Out with circuitous diplomacy and phrases like “two-state solution.” In with bold action creating momentum toward what Mr. Trump calls “a new dawn.”

Mr. Trump’s grand vision is to combine Gulf capital, Lebanese commercial ingenuity, Israeli technology and a large Arab work force to produce economic miracles that conciliate the Middle East.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Disarming Hezbollah, he tells Lebanese leaders, will “bring in the Saudis and the Qataris, who have been burned in Lebanon because they tried and the money went to corruption.”

Mr. Salam told me that Mr. Barrack had suggested simultaneous steps by Israel and Hezbollah as the way forward.
Speaker: Salam
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Hezbollah hands over some weapons and vacates part of the country, Israel withdraws from two of the five points, and so on,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It was an excellent idea of his, but nothing.”

‘What Is the Point?’

On Sept. 21, the day after the killing below Beaufort Castle, Israel acted as it deemed necessary in the town of Bint Jbeil in southern Lebanon.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Asked about the incident, the Israeli military said it had targeted an unnamed Hezbollah operative and “during the neutralization of the terrorist in an airstrike, a second vehicle carrying civilians approached the target, and as a result of the strike that vehicle was hit, too.”

It added that it “regrets any harm caused to uninvolved individuals.”

Thousands of people attended the funeral of the family on Sept. 23.
Speaker: It
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The Mechanism reported to the Lebanese prime minister that it had held an “excellent meeting.”

“A half-hour later I get another call reporting five killed, including three children, by an Israeli drone strike in Bint Jbeil,” Mr. Salam said.
Speaker: Salam
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I feel frustrated, but what is the point of protesting again and again?”

--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “This was not a compliance lapse; it was a business model,” said Jonathan Missner, a lawyer for some of the more than 70 families named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Our investigation shows that Binance built systems designed to evade oversight, using its off-chain network and weak controls to move enormous sums for sanctioned groups.”

Binance declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We comply fully with internationally recognized sanctions laws, consistent with other financial institutions,” the company said in a written statement.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Those who helped make these atrocities possible shouldn’t get to hide behind computer screens,” Mr. Balva said in a written statement.
Speaker: Balva
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Binance’s platform moved the money that helped fund the violence that destroyed our family.”

The lawsuit details more claimed transactions with Hamas than were revealed by the Justice Department, the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and other regulators in their 2023 settlement agreement with Binance.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: When Binance settled in 2023 with U.S. regulators, the company said in a blog post that it acknowledged “our company’s responsibility for historical, criminal compliance violations.”

TÉMOIGNAGE: “There is no denying that U.S. taxpayer dollars are undergirding what is happening: the utter destruction of Gaza,” Ms. Avilés said in an interview.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “You can now run for even higher office, as mayor of New York City, and say these things head-on.”

And in the Bronx, Representative Ritchie Torres, another firm ally of Israel, is being challenged by Michael Blake, a former state assemblyman who is trying to court voters opposed to Israel’s actions in its war against Hamas.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I will invest in the community,” Mr. Blake said on social media when he announced his run.
Speaker: Blake
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Ritchie invests in bombs.”

The results of the mayor’s race showed that Jewish New Yorkers differed greatly in their opinions of Israel.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: For years, he said, there had been “non-Jewish politicians who have been great friends to the Jewish community and understand our rootedness here in New York and our vulnerabilities.”

“I hope that people like Ritchie Torres and Hakeem Jeffries are not the last liberal friends of Israel and friends of the Jews to be elected to Congress,” said Rabbi Kalmanofsky, who opposed Mr. Mamdani.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: In her response to an endorsement questionnaire from the New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, which was obtained by The New York Times, she wrote that the United States “needs to stop supporting colonialism, from San Juan to Gaza.”

Mr. Goldman, who was endorsed by J Street, a liberal pro-Israel group, has criticized Mr. Netanyahu’s government but remains a staunch supporter of Israel and has taken donations from AIPAC and accepted its endorsement.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Israel’s right to safely and securely exist as a Jewish, democratic state is fundamental to Dan’s relationship with his Jewish faith,” said Simone Kanter, a spokesman for Mr. Goldman.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Asking Dan to renounce Israel because of its government’s indefensible actions is akin to asking him to renounce his faith.”

So far Mr. Mamdani has not taken a position on any of the congressional challengers except for Mr. Lander, whom he has encouraged to run against Mr. Goldman.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Mr. Ossé said that he was “definitely not running for Congress without the support of NYC-DSA.”

Even as Mr. Ossé appeared to exit the race, Mr. Espaillat and Representative Grace Meng, a Queens Democrat, drew attacks last week from challengers for accepting donations from groups like AIPAC.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I don’t like that she is beholden to a small set of huge donors, and that is one of those groups,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “She is responding to big checks and big donors rather than the needs of voters in Queens.”

Matt Rey, a spokesman for Ms. Meng, called Mr. Park an opportunist who was ignoring how the congresswoman had been “delivering for immigrants, families and seniors.”

Mr. Blake, meanwhile, who is challenging Mr. Torres after losing to him in a 2020 primary and then placing near the bottom of the mayoral primary field this year, has undergone a complete refashioning of his position on Israel.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Adam Harris, an AIPAC spokesman, said Mr. Blake’s “180-degree reversal” surprised the group since he had spoken at pro-Israel events “and received considerable financial support from the community.”

Mr. Blake explained that his views had shifted during Israel’s invasion of Gaza, which before a cease-fire last month had killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and displaced even more.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It’s no different than what we’ve seen in terms of people shifting as it relates to other conflicts, like the Iraq War,” he said, accusing Mr. Torres of focusing more on Israel than on his own district.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Benny Stanislawski⁩, a spokesman for Mr. Torres, disputed this, saying that the congressman had been “fighting to make sure the Bronx gets its fair share.”

Israeli-Backed Gaza Aid Outfit Shunned by Humanitarian Groups Shuts Down

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said it had succeeded in delivering million of meals in the war-torn enclave, but some Palestinians were killed trying to obtain them.
Speaker: The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The organization’s chief, John Acree, said in a statement on Monday that the foundation, known as the G.H.F., had a single mission — to “feed civilians in desperate need” — and that it had “successfully” met this goal by delivering millions of meals in Gaza over about four and a half months.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: In July, the foundation said that 20 people had been killed in a stampede near a site after what it said were armed agitators prompted a “chaotic and dangerous surge.” It blamed Hamas for the violence.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: as a replacement for the U.N. distribution network, but he told Fox News in an interview in September that the new endeavor “unfortunately did not work.” He blamed Hamas.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: It said it had been unable to open more locations because of “a lack of aid and access.”

The group lamented “legacy aid organizations” that declined to collaborate with it and said its original plan “was never permitted to be fully implemented.”

Stéphane Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman, declined to comment  other than to say that there had been “no collaboration” with the G.H.F.
Speaker: It
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The foundation said it was not going to dissolve and “will maintain readiness to reconstitute if new humanitarian needs are identified.”

Israeli Military Commanders Face Ouster Over Oct. 7 Failures

About a dozen people were told they face dismissal or discipline for mistakes tied to the deadly Hamas-led attack that set off the war in Gaza.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: General Zamir said in a statement on Sunday that the Israeli military had “failed in its primary mission on Oct. 7 — to protect the civilians of the state of Israel.” He described it as a “severe, resounding, systemic failure” that warranted action to restore trust in the military and “to set a clear standard of command responsibility.”

“I have decided, after careful consideration, to draw personal conclusions regarding commanders holding certain positions who served on Oct. 7,” General Zamir said.
Speaker: General Zamir
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Having considered the conclusions, individual assessments of responsibility were “a necessary step,” he said Sunday.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: General Zamir spoke highly of the officers even as he announced that they would be disciplined and said it was “not easy to make decisions that affect people I appreciate and who dedicated their lives to the security of the nation.”

But, he said, “If we do not sharpen the meaning of responsibility, trust in the system will erode.”

Israel Assassinated a Top Hezbollah Commander Near Beirut

Escalating its attacks on the Iran-backed militant group in Lebanon, Israel killed Hezbollah’s military chief of staff in an airstrike on an apartment building.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “My policy is clear: Under my leadership, Israel will not allow Hezbollah to build its power anew and again constitute a threat,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a televised statement on Sunday night, hours after the attack.
Speaker: Netanyahu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Mahmoud Kamati, the deputy head of Hezbollah’s political council, said in a statement that the Israeli attack “breaches a new red line,” though he did not immediately vow retaliation.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: He said the Israeli attack was proof that “agreements are useless with the enemy.”

“We are coordinating with the Lebanese state to put an end to this Israeli violation,” he added in the statement distributed by Hezbollah’s media office.
Speaker: He
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Joseph Aoun, Lebanon’s president, condemned the attack, writing on social media that Israel was rejecting “all the efforts and initiatives put forward to end to the escalation.”

Mr. Tabatabai had previously commanded Hezbollah’s special forces in operations across the region, including in Syria and Yemen, according to the U.S. State Department, which had offered a reward of up to $5 million for information on him.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “This seems to be a military move aimed at adding more political momentum for the Lebanese government to move ahead with disarmament, as part of the cease-fire,” said Mr. Orion.

20 Killed in Israeli Strikes as Israel and Hamas Trade Blame Over Truce

Violence has repeatedly flared up in the weeks since a cease-fire was reached, killing hundreds of Palestinians and at least three Israeli soldiers.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We call upon the mediators to intervene urgently and place pressure to immediately halt these violations, just as we are calling on the American government to uphold its commitments,” the Palestinian militant group said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The Israeli government said five of those killed were “senior Hamas terrorists,” but did not give their names or positions.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The updated voting rules aim to “discourage disproportionate promotion campaigns,” the European Broadcasting Union said in a news release, “particularly when undertaken or supported by third parties, including governments or governmental agencies.” Eurovision viewers can vote online, via text message and by phone, and the maximum number of votes that a viewer can cast will be capped at 10 by each method, rather than the previous 20, the news release said.
Speaker: European Broadcasting Union
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Promotion is an important part of the music industry and the Eurovision Song Contest but we need to ensure it’s proportionate and fair,” Dave Goodman, a spokesman for the union, said in an email on Friday.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: After the ensuing backlash, Martin Green, the Eurovision director, wrote an open letter defending the voting process and saying that all forms of voting showed “shows evidence of the motivation of communities or diasporas around certain contestants.”

Eurovision’s organizers have been struggling to resolve the tension over Israel’s participation, and in September the Eurovision Broadcasting Union board said it planned to hold an extraordinary general meeting at which member broadcasters would vote on whether to continue to include the country.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Kan, Israel’s public broadcaster, agreed to change the lyrics to the song, “October Rain.”

Along with the changes announced on Friday, Green said, Eurovision also vowed to “strengthen enforcement of our existing rules to prevent any misuse of the contest for example through song lyrics or staging.”

Next year’s contest will be held in Austria after that country’s contestant, JJ, took home the 2025 title.
Speaker: Green
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: In response, Israeli forces were “striking Hamas terrorist targets across the Gaza Strip,” the military’s statement said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Hamas said Israel’s assertion that its troops had been targeted was a “transparent attempt to justify its ongoing crimes.” The Palestinian militant group called on the United States to rein in Israeli military actions.
Speaker: Hamas
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Time to develop the cohort of Palestinian “technocrats” whom the plan imagines administering Gaza.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “If this plan brings some or any stability, if it can finally help us rebuild our lives, then it is something we welcome,” said Mr. Abu Tawahina, a physiotherapist working as a van driver.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “But we have learned to wait and see, because promises alone are not enough.”

There is another prerequisite for many countries that are being asked to commit forces to the demilitarization effort: being told upfront whether their troops will be asked to disarm the Palestinian militant group Hamas and its thousands of surviving fighters.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The group rejected the U.N. resolution, saying on Tuesday that involving the International Stabilization Force in disarming it would turn the force into “a party to the conflict on behalf of” Israel.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The U.N. resolution at least holds out the prospect of a “pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood” and a future role for the Authority, but only after it has completed a reform program that no one has fully spelled out.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “If, in the future, the Gazans change their spots” and become peace seekers, then Israel can sit down and talk to them, he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “The resolution has no teeth.”

It is also unclear whether, even with the U.N. resolution in hand, Arab nations will send troops to Gaza without an invitation from the Palestinian Authority, lest they be denounced as collaborators with Israel in a military occupation.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “Disarming Hamas will be a process; it will take time,” said Nimrod Novik, a veteran Israeli peace negotiator.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “And if there is no further Israeli withdrawal, however limited, and no International Stabilization Force, and no beginning of reconstruction, then the temporary becomes permanent.”

“And,” he added, “we have a situation where Israel is here.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Each controls half the strip, and the inevitable friction will mean a resumption of fighting.”

To supporters of a two-state solution to the conflict, the Trump administration’s forceful approach to Mr. Netanyahu in achieving the cease-fire in Gaza has been hugely welcome.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: If the administration were as aggressive with Israel on the West Bank as it has been in Gaza, he said, “then it could be a great turning point for the region.”

Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: A working group on issues of civil governance broke up the week into themed days, including “wellness Wednesdays” for health care and education, and “thirsty Thursdays” for water infrastructure.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: A map of Gaza in the center of the vast room showed a “red zone” still controlled by Hamas and a “green zone” controlled by Israel.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: The center’s efforts now include some planning for “alternate safe communities,” according to more than eight diplomats and officials — new residential compounds that the Trump administration is considering building for Palestinians in parts of Gaza still controlled by Israel.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “The situation in Gaza is so dreadful, you would take such a risk,” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: South Africa’s foreign minister, Ronald Lamola, suggested on Monday that Israel was behind what he called “a clear agenda to cleanse the Palestinians out of Gaza and the West Bank” — an accusation Israel has denied.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “It does seem like they were being, you know, flushed out,” said President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, adding that his government had a duty to accept Palestinians because they are “a different and special case of a people that we have supported as a country.”

The Israeli military said it received approval from a third country to send the Palestinian families there, but it did not name the country.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “The border authorities were unwilling to consider the factors that these people came from Gaza, that there’s a humanitarian crisis,” said Na’eem Jeenah, a South African activist who has assisted the Palestinians.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “They were looking at it very narrowly.”

Mr. Shehada, who has worked for a U.N. agency since 2014, said when his flight arrived on Oct. 28, passengers were allowed to get off the plane and go through immigration just like any other international arrival.

TÉMOIGNAGE: “We said to ourselves, ‘What if they have no connection with the Israeli army and we go into Rafah and they start shooting at the buses?’” Mr. Shehada said.

TÉMOIGNAGE: Al-Majd had kept them in the dark about how they ended up in South Africa, Mr. Saif said: “We didn’t even know where we were going.”

After a local aid organization offered accommodation for the entire group, they were allowed into the country on a 90-day visa exemption that South Africa grants Palestinians.
Speaker: Saif
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “The other day she was telling me, ‘Dad, we are living like the YouTube life,’” he said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “The rain was heavy, and the holes were too many.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Our mattresses and blankets were flooded,” said Mr. Owada, 23, who lives in the tent with his parents and three younger siblings.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “I have no plan, I gave up planning long time ago.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: With zero resources, planning is meaningless,” he added.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We are just trying to survive here.”

The punishing rain and chilling winds that have swept through Gaza since Friday are a bitter reminder that despite a cease-fire that went into effect last month, life remains far from normal for the enclave’s two million people.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Roughly 1.5 million people are in need of “emergency shelter items” in Gaza, according to the U.N., which also assesses that the war damaged or destroyed around 81 percent of all structures in the enclave.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: Israel is working on a “catered humanitarian response” for the coming winter, COGAT added.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “We just waited until the morning, hoping for some sun to dry off our stuff.
Speaker: Inconnu

TÉMOIGNAGE: But it’s now raining again,” she said.
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: “How can we live like this?
Speaker: Inconnu
--------------------------------------------------
TÉMOIGNAGE: It is another kind of suffering that no one seems to care about,” Ms. al-Qudeiry said.
Speaker: Qudeiry
